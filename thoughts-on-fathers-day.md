<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once observed:<br></p>

> Of the many magnificent purposes served in the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, one... aspect... often goes uncelebrated. His followers did not understand it fully at the time, and many in modern Christianity do not grasp it now, but the Savior Himself spoke of it repeatedly and emphatically. It is the grand truth that in all that Jesus came to say and do, including and especially in His atoning suffering and sacrifice, He was showing us who and what God our Eternal Father is like, how completely devoted He is to His children in every age and nation. In word and in deed Jesus was trying to reveal and make personal to us the true nature of His Father, our Father in Heaven."</p><cite>"<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god?lang=eng">The Grandeur of God</a>", Oct 2003</cite>

<p>Thus, Jesus expects us to take Him seriously when He says, "true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4.23?lang=eng&clang=eng#p21">John 4:23</a>), and when He prays to the Father: "This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17.3?lang=eng&clang=eng#p1">John 17:3</a>) And He hopes we will <em>long</em> for the blessing that He promised when He said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.23?lang=eng&clang=eng#p22">John 14:23</a>)</p>



<p>It is not a coincidence that our <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.1?lang=eng">Articles of Faith begin</a> with, "We believe in God the Eternal Father." It is not a coincidence that the greatest of all dispensations — the time in which "those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.18?lang=eng#p17">D&C 128:18</a>) — began with a personal encounter between a Father and a child that He called by name — and that our 3-year-old Sunbeams now sing "I am a child of God." It is not a coincidence that <a href="ordinances-are-evidence-of-gods-love">after hearing our own names</a> in sacred ordinances, the approving seal of divinity that's invoked always references our Father first. It is not a coincidence that the Lord's prayer, offered as the grand prototype for all of our spiritual yearnings, begins with the words, "Our Father."</p>



<h2>It's personal</h2>



<p>And please note the personal pronoun, because our Great Exemplar repeatedly, emphatically, insisted on viewing the relationship with Father as being intimately personal: </p>

<p>This message — that God is not just a cosmic manifestation of goodness, or a stern immortal demanding our worship, but rather <em>our</em> Father who loves each one of us, individually and personally, and who wants to be bound to us forever — has been repeatedly taught by prophets. Paul reminds us, "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8.15?lang=eng#p14">Rom 8:15</a>). And we have Enoch report the Father's words: "Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency; And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.28,32,33?lang=eng#p31,32">Moses 7:32-33</a>) And we have Brigham Young teaching, "[God] is the Father of our spirits; and if we could know, understand, and do His will, every soul would be prepared to return back into His presence. And when they get there, they would see that they had formerly lived there for ages, that they had previously been acquainted with every nook and corner, with the palaces, walks, and gardens; and they would embrace their Father, and He would embrace them and say, 'My son, my daughter, I have you again;' and the child would say, 'O my Father, my Father, I am here again.'" (<a href="https://scriptures.byu.edu/#:t9c72&palaces:st&1396&1830&2021&j&n&30@0$palaces"><em>Journal of Discourses</em>, Vol. 4, p. 286</a>) And we have President Uchtdorf saying, "Brothers and sisters, the most powerful Being in the universe is the Father of your spirit. He knows you. He loves you with a perfect love. God sees you not only as a mortal being on a small planet who lives for a brief season—He sees you as His child. He sees you as the being you are capable and designed to become. He wants you to know that you matter to Him." ("<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/10/you-matter-to-him?lang=eng">You Matter to Him</a>", Oct 2011).</p>



<p>In other words, God will not leave <em>any</em> one of us, His children, fatherless.</p>



<h2>Coming closer to Him</h2>



<p>So, are we living up to our privilege and invitation to know our Father? Do we seek to <em>truly</em>, <em>deeply</em> understand His heart? Is He on our mind? Do we think about how He feels? Do we talk to Him — not just in formulaic prayers, but as a child who needs the listening ear, the counsel, the encouragement, the reassurance of someone who loves us perfectly? Do we long to be closer to Him? </p>



<p>One way we can come to understand our Father better is by observing with spiritual eyes.</p>



<h2>Learning from Jesus's Emulation</h2>



<p>What do we see when we look at Jesus, the Son who was in the express image of His — and our — Father?</p>



<p>Well, we learn that Father is the sort of person who turns water to wine as a kindness to an anxious mother.</p>



<p>Father is the sort of person who foregoes a meal to have a heart-to-heart conversation with a woman at a well — even if that woman isn't having much success keeping the commandments.</p>



<p>Father loves to hold little children.</p>

<p>Father weeps with compassion at the grief of Marys and Marthas (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/11.35?lang=eng&clang=eng#p33">John 11:35</a>).</p>



<p>Father is utterly unimpressed by worldly pomp — but riveted by a daughter reaching out to grasp a robe in a crowd, or a daughter dropping a tiny coin into the temple treasury.</p>



<p>Father feels, intensely, that lonely widows need the consolation of their children. (<em>Jehovah gave commandments about this in the Law of Moses, and taught this principle when He inspired Elijah to raise the son of the widow of Zarephath. And then, to be sure we got the point, as Jesus He personally modelled it twice more for us — first with the widow of Nain, and then with Mary and John, on the cross.</em>)</p>



<p>I believe Jesus even reveals to us some of the personal hygiene habits of our Father, as He neatly folds burial clothes before laying them aside in an empty tomb. (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/20.6-7?lang=eng&clang=eng#p5">John 20:6-7</a>)</p>



<p>"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21.25?lang=eng#p25">John 21:25</a>). But since books are limiting and very few of us lived next to Jesus in mortality, Father in his tender outreach to us places other types and shadows in our lives that teach us the same sorts of lessons, in ways suited to our individual circumstances. In many cases, those types and shadows manifest in earthly fathers that we have known and loved, if we have eyes to see. For example:</p>



<h2>Learning from Earthly Fathers</h2>



<p>When I was seven or eight, I vividly remember driving with my dad through early morning fog to an apple orchard that the church owned. There we spent hours clearing away weeds and pruning. I remember my dad's eyes swelling with the pollen, and I remember him sneezing miserably — but staying till the end of the welfare assignment because service and priesthood duty matter. My dad gave me a glimpse of the heart of Father that day.</p>



<p>I remember my dad laughing as he carried me on his shoulders when I was little. That, too, was a revelation about the nature of our Father in Heaven.</p>



<p>My dad has plenty of mortal foibles, but as the years go by, the aspects of his character that hold my attention are the tender and sweet ones. I remember my dad building bunkbeds and climby things for kids. I remember my dad bearing a sincere and loving testimony of Jesus. I remember my dad giving me a blessing when I was sick — and how comforted and safe I felt. I hope many of us can relate to intimate and simple revelations like these.</p>

<p>I want to acknowledge that some of us may find earthly fathers a hard topic. Not all of us have had good experiences with the mortal men who carry that title — and <em>none</em> of us have had perfection. My own assignment as a father has taught me a sober lesson about just how <em>raw</em> the material is that God has to work with when he makes a man into a father. But — praise God! — our Father is the Great Prototype from which Jesus learned to be a fixer of broken things and a plugger of gaps. Sometimes He does that with grandfathers, with fathers-in-law, with fathers of our ward, with President Hinckleys and President Nelsons that He puts in our lives. From men like this, I have learned:</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who delights to slip a Mickey Mouse watch on his daughter's wrist while she sleeps, so the gift is the first thing she sees when she wakes up on her birthday.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who calls his wife "sugar" or "darling" or "sweetheart" every day for sixty years.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who musters courage to march off to fight in World War II to protect his wife and children.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who gets his hands dirty and his shirt sweaty planting and harvesting a garden — and who wants his kids to work alongside him.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who gives up the dream of a career as a dentist, and instead stretches the timetable of his education and shows up year after year at a less interesting job, to provide a stable home.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who buys birdseed for decades to stock feeders in his back yard, and who takes care of old, feeble dogs, shedding tears when they pass away.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who can't endorse his daughter's plan to marry a man who is unworthy of her, and who tells her this awkward truth as gently as he can — but who rejoices years later at her temple wedding to a true helpmeet.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the grandpa who climbs thirty feet into an oak tree to hang straps for a giant swing so little ones can have a thrilling ride with each visit.</p>



<h2>Learning from Personal Encounters</h2>



<p>Revelations of Father via others are tender mercies. But we are not limited to that type of revelation. Father wants to teach us about Himself in ways that are very direct and private and sacred. After some pondering, I'd like to share one such experience with you. </p>



<p>Years ago, I was feeling heavily burdened from my own fatherhood. I have worried plenty for each of my children, but on this occasion, Caleb was the one rending my heart. He was in residential treatment far away from our home. I knew he was discouraged. I prayed for inspiration.</p>



<p>My son happened to be a fan of souped up hot rods, and a feeling that came to me through my prayers was that I ought to buy my son a hot rod of his own — something that he could be proud of, and that he could look forward to driving and sharing with his friends when he was home again. I felt that it would give him hope, and that perhaps we could work together to make it fancier.</p>



<p>Still, even though we could cover the costs without debt and I had Linda's approval, I felt a bit conflicted. The car I bought was old enough that the expense wasn't astronomical — but it was significant. I had so many other things to spend money on. My son might have to wait years to drive this car — or might never get to drive it at all. Was I wasting financial resources that the Lord had given us?</p>



<p>As I drove away from the car dealership, all of these doubts, plus worries for my son's welfare, weighed on me. And then I felt Father speak. He simply said, "<em>I</em> would do this." And I knew that He understood everything that was in my heart. He knew that the need for hope and happiness for my son was profoundly important — that I was not just throwing money away, but making a gesture that embodied all the kindness and hope and sunshine a father longed to bring into his son's life. He approved. Kids mattered; money didn't.</p>



<p>Well, that car proved to be a highlight of my son's life. He <em>was</em> thrilled with the gift, and he <em>did</em> talk about it often while he was in residential treatment. He drew pictures. He made plans.</p>



<p>But the Mustang also gathered dust in our driveway for years. And when our son completed his residential treatment, he wasn't able to get a driver's license right away, so it sat some more. And soon after we fired it up and drove around town for the first time, its engine threw a rod, and it died.</p>



<p>Now Father's simple affirmation, "<em>I</em> would do it," took on new meaning for me. He had whispered that to me, even knowing the end from the beginning. He still approved of the exchange of some money for the happiness and hope of the gift.</p>



<p>Years after this event, our car-loving son took his own life, a victim to the demons of mental illness that he had fought for so long. It was a tragic event for our entire family, and one that I am still grieving over. He is as precious to me as each of my other children, and sometimes I have wondered how any of us could go on without him.</p>



<p>After the graveside service, some of Caleb's friends got in a hot rod and peeled out along the road by the cemetery, and Linda and I smiled at each other through our tears. And sometimes, in the days since, we have seen a fancy car pull up next to us in a parking lot or in traffic, and we have said to each other, "Caleb is saying hello to us."</p>



<p>Earlier this week, I was up in the middle of the night with insomnia. I felt an impression to go through an untidy bundle of papers on the shelf. (We've been in the process of our move to Switzerland for months now, and I am completely sick and tired of sorting through boxes and papers. Easier to just toss the whole pile and be done with it. But since Father had prompted me, I got out the bundle and began sorting. Two o'clock in the morning. Ugh!)</p>



<p>Well, in the middle of those papers I found an unmarked envelope. I opened it and found a short, undated letter in Caleb's familiar handwriting. It said:</p>

<p>I am certain that Heavenly Father smiled as I read that note, and that He did so through tears that were pretty similar to my own. And I bear you my direct, first-person witness that our Father is a man who loves love notes from a child, and the enthusiasm of teenage boys for hot rods, and giving generous gifts, and whispering to tired fathers in the quiet of the night. He longs to hold us in His arms again, as He has done so many times in the past, and have us hug Him back and claim Him as our own. Let us give that Father's Day gift to Him.</p>
