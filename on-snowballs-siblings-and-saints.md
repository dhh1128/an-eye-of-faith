<h2>I. Snowballs</h2>



<p>Years ago, I threw a snowball at my favorite seminary teacher. It was an act of affection in my 14-year-old mind — I felt playful. She was chatting with family as she opened her car door after church, and I expected her to chuckle at a fluffy thud nearby.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I threw from far away; a lot of kinetic energy was involved. Plus I gave no warning, I packed the snow too much, and I was more accurate than I intended. My teacher's recoil, and her expression as she wiped the spray of ice from her face, still fill me with dismay.</p>

<p>I startled and hurt this kind woman who'd been my friend. I gave her a scare about scratches to her eye, and I caused her some pain. Despite innocent intentions, I conveyed disrespect and earned her disappointment.</p>



<p>My teacher didn't hide her discomfort, but neither did she remonstrate. I apologized. She waved a reassurance. Then she got in her car and meekly drove away. She never brought it up with me again, and I believe she forgave me.</p>



<h2>II. Siblings</h2>



<p>My family talks about politics from time to time. One Sunday evening we got on the subject, and my brother articulated some ideas that I considered wrong-headed. I told him so — and I wasn't very gentle about it. Several others chimed in, adding a variety of perspectives. Words flew back and forth. I wouldn't say the spirit in the room was ugly, but it got a bit impatient and tense.</p>



<p>My sister interrupted us with a heartfelt lecture on why family unity was more important than winning a political debate. She spoke for a long time, and she was so impassioned that I began to feel a bit hurt. I hadn't thought I was <em>that</em> over-the-top. But I also saw the wisdom in what she was saying. Apparently I'd thrown another snowball. So much for teenage lessons learned...</p>



<p>I swallowed my pride and agreed to end that particular discussion — and to never have another one like it. I have tried sincerely. I've had some successes and some failures. Particularly in the last year or two, I've struggled to be a witness of truths that feel important to me, without becoming contentious.</p>



<h2>III. Saints</h2>



<p>On June 5, 1834, a group known as Zion's Camp crossed the Mississippi River into Missouri. They had come to redress wrongs that members of the church — "saints" — were suffering at the hands of local settlers. Joseph Smith was their leader.</p>



<p>The journey to Missouri had been physically and emotionally demanding. Members of the camp did not always get along. Tempers frayed. Sickness had been a problem. George A. Smith, the prophet's young cousin, recalled, "most of the men in the Camp complained to him of sore toes, blistered feet, long drives, scanty supply of provisions, poor quality of bread, bad corn dodger, frowsy butter, strong honey, maggoty bacon and cheese." [George A. Smith, “My Journal,” Instructor, May 1946, 217] On top of this, Missourians were hostile enough that there were concerns for personal safety — so much so that Samuel Baker, the oldest member of the camp, gifted Joseph a huge mastiff guard dog named Major. [Alexander Baugh, "Joseph Smith’s Dog, Old Major", BYU Studies Quarterly 56:4. <a href="https://j.mp/34TlXJi">https://j.mp/34TlXJi</a>.]</p>

<p>Joseph apparently loved this dog. They bonded on the trek. His children developed fond memories of the animal. "Old Major" even stayed with him later, during Joseph's bleak winter months at Liberty Jail. [Ibid]</p>



<p>But not everyone in the company appreciated Major during that June expedition. Sylvester Smith (no relation to Joseph) became annoyed when the dog had to be kept from attacking men who marched into camp under Sylvester's direction. Apparently his feelings were strong enough that he insulted Joseph at length, and threatened to kill the dog. The next night as the camp tried to sleep, Major barked a lot, enraging Sylvester further. He repeated his threat against the dog. This angered Joseph, who told Sylvester, "If you kill that dog I will whip you." [George A. Smith, <em>Memoirs of George A. Smith</em>, 29] Feelings between the two men remained raw for months afterward. [See Godfrey and others, <em>Documents</em>, Volume 4, 125, 129–30, The Joseph Smith Papers. <a href="http://j.mp/353UCo4">http://j.mp/353UCo4</a>.]</p>



<h2>IV. Meditations</h2>



<p>One thread running through each of these stories is the idea that people sometimes behave in hurtful ways. We all get hit by a snowball, now and then. We all have to put up with a clueless brother, or a person who hates our dog, or a dog whose owner isn't sympathetic enough to our feelings.</p>



<p>Another thread is the sobering realization that sometimes, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">we</span> are those flawed people. All of us have lobbed a metaphorical snowball that did unintended damage. All of us have been stung by our own experience with the early Christian lament, "the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil" (James 3:8). And all of us have become annoyed at circumstances that ruined a night's sleep — or at someone who unfairly held us responsible for such circumstances.</p>



<p>These are important lessons, but perhaps they are the beginning of the learning, rather than the end. I think they should lead us to prize more highly the grace, granted and received, that must be poured into stories like these to give them tolerable endings.</p>



<p>If our family relationships are predominantly happy, grace like this tends to play a big role. Yes, we can remember the time we fought with a brother over clothes he "borrowed", or the unkind judgment passed by a grandparent. But we tend to view the relationship as <em>bigger</em> — more valuable, more multidimensional, more fraught with potential and moral implications — than a few bad memories, or even than a lot of them. Our family members, with all their shortcomings, are also our most intimate friends and allies, and even when we look into their souls and see things we don't love, we can't bear to let that be all that we see. So we seek out, acknowledge, and prize the goodness, too. We look for ways to give one another the benefit of the doubt. We forgive. We make room for the relationship to continue, and to improve. And we hope our loved ones feel the same. Often — perhaps more often than we deserve — they do. Maybe this miracle is among the things Tolstoy intended when he said that all happy families are alike.</p>



<p>The miracle of grace doesn't happen without effort, of course. And some situations are so painful that we can't find grace for a long time, or maybe we can't find it at all. Thomas S. Monson shared a story from the Associated Press about two brothers who quarreled when they were young men. They drew a chalk line down the middle of their shared cabin, and refused to cross it or even speak to one another for the next 62 years, until one of the brothers died. ["School Thy Feelings, O My Brother", Oct 2009. <a href="http://j.mp/3rQkXzD">http://j.mp/3rQkXzD</a>]</p>



<p>But when we hear stories like this, or when we live them, we feel deep sadness. We long for a different ending. This is why my heart swells with admiration and wonder when I think about Mary, who as an elderly woman described for me her childhood experiences with a neglectful, alcoholic stepfather. In a few simple sentences, she recounted her family's poverty from this man spending all his income on booze, and spoke of her mother's wrenching decision to divorce. Then she said something like, "But he wasn't a bad man, in many ways. Things were just hard back then. If we hadn't moved to Vegas, I never would have met my husband." And that was as much as she wanted to say about him.</p>



<p>Oh, Mary! What grace!</p>



<h2>V. Those Other Brothers and Sisters</h2>



<p>We often acknowledge that granting and seeking grace in our families is a divine charge. But are we as mindful of others that Jesus also wants us to treat like our brothers and sisters? Elder Neal A. Maxwell worried that we may be approaching our relationships with fellow believers, and with the thoroughly human officers that lead us in religious contexts, with very different standards:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>There are so many just waiting to be offended. They are so alerted to the possibility that they will not be treated fairly, they almost invite the verification of their expectation! The meek, not on such a fatiguing alert, find rest from this form of fatigue.</p><p>Bruising as the tumble off the peak of pride is, it may be necessary at times. Few of us escape at least some of these bruises. Even then, one must next be careful not to continue his descent into the swamp of self-pity. Meekness enables us, after such a tumble, to pick ourselves up—but without putting others down blamefully. Meekness mercifully lets us retain the realistic and rightful impressions of how blessed we are, so far as the fundamental things of eternity are concerned. We are not then as easily offended by the disappointments of the day, of which there seems to be a sufficient and steady supply.</p><p>When we are thus spiritually settled, we will likewise be less apt to murmur and complain. Indeed, one of the great risks of murmuring is that we can get too good at it, too clever. We can even acquire too large an audience. Furthermore, what for the murmurer may only be transitory grumbles may become a cause for a hearer that may carry him or her clear out of the Church.
</p><cite>"Meek and Lowly", speech at BYU, Oct 1986. <a href="http://j.mp/37XmVGi">http://j.mp/37XmVGi</a></cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>Perhaps we're tolerant of foibles in our peers, but we draw the line at leaders, who we feel have a special duty to earn the "saint" moniker they're supposed to exemplify: "This is the bishop (or the relief society president, or the prophet) we're talking about! How could the church be true (or a divine instrument) if he betrayed a confidence, or she refused to spend church funds to help in our hour of need, or he dissembled, or she said something that was prejudiced?"</p>



<p>Elder Maxwell continues:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>...Since life in the Church illustrates, painfully at times, our own defects, as well as the defects of others, we are bound to be periodically disappointed thereby in ourselves and in others. We cannot expect it to be otherwise in a kingdom where, initially, not only does the net gather “of every kind,” but those of “every kind” are also at every stage of spiritual development (see Matthew 13:47). When people “leave their nets straightway” (see Matthew 4:20 and Mark 1:18), they come as they are—though in the initial process of changing, their luggage reflects their past. Hence, discipleship is a developmental journey that requires shared patience, understanding, and meekness on the part of all who join the caravan...</p><p>...The disciple’s course involves more lab and fieldwork than lectures.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>It's interesting to me that in articulating this principle, Elder Maxwell references Peter leaving his nets. Peter, as we all know, had a lionlike devotion to the Lord. He made extraordinary sacrifices. Aside from the Lord himself, he is the only person that scriptures describe walking on water. In the Savior's name and with faith like a rock, he healed a man lame from his mother's womb — and boldly testified before the Sanhedrin when called to account for it. Tradition has it that he asked to be crucified upside down to discourage comparisons between his own martyrdom and the one of the Master he loved. Popes point to him as their predecessor and exemplar, and operate out of a basilica erected in his honor.</p>



<p>Peter was also the man who urged the Lord to walk away because Peter felt too sinful to remain in His presence. He forgot the Lord's gentle teachings on tolerance and cut off the ear of an attacker. He wept bitterly because he had denied the Lord three times. After witnessing the miracle of the resurrection, he went fishing instead of going out to share the gospel. And even after a remarkable vision, he was reluctant to abandon the prejudices of Judaism and welcome gentiles without precondition; Paul had to rebuke him before his actions matched his words.</p>



<p>It's the same Peter.</p>



<p>So, pelted with metaphorical snowballs, were Peter's contemporaries justified in complaining loudly, or in quitting the church Jesus left in Peter's hands? How might recitations of Peter's offenses play before a Judge who once refused to condemn a woman taken in adultery, whose only public response to Peter's three-fold denial was to look at him, and who patiently prepared a meal for Peter before urging him to do a better job of feeding the sheep? Would not Peter's accusers also be defendants before that same Judge, in that same court of justice — their only defense the infinite price the Judge had personally paid to show them mercy?</p>



<p>We may find Peter an unchallenging test of our forgiveness here; none of us were personally wounded by him, his life had a clear upward trend, we don't have any writings of his critics, and the gulf in culture and time between us and him lets us forgive without a lot of angst. He can be a "saint." But if we ask the same question about Joseph Smith, do we give the same answer?</p>



<p>We may know the Savior's command to forgive all men in D&C 64, but forget the context around it. It was <em>this exact question</em> — whether Joseph as a flawed, human prophet had any claim on our forgiveness — that elicited the Lord's strong words:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>There are those who have sought occasion against him [Joseph] without cause; Nevertheless, he has sinned; but verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, forgive sins unto those who confess their sins before me and ask forgiveness, who have not sinned unto death. My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened. Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin. I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>It seems to me that regardless of encumbering details, the worry some believers feel about Joseph's character could be laid to rest by simply allowing the Lord to have the last word on the subject. He has addressed the indictment. Will we accept His judgment, or not?</p>



<p>Sometimes we may resemble a man in C.S. Lewis's <em>The Great Divorce</em>, troubled that the messenger sent to invite him to heaven has a less angelic backstory than he, the invited guest. Confronting this flawed-but-for-grace messenger, Lewis's character complains:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>I’d have thought you and I ought to be the other way round… I gone straight all my life. I don’t say I was a religious man and I don’t say I had no faults, far from it. But I done my best all my life, see? ... I never asked for anything that wasn’t mine by rights.… You may think you can put me down because you’re dressed up like that (which you weren’t when you worked under me) and I’m only a poor man. But I got to have my rights same as you, see?... And what I don’t see is why I should be put below a bloody murderer like you. I’m not asking for anybody’s bleeding charity.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>The formerly sinful messenger responds to this complaint with some profound advice:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>But the offended man turns away instead, unwilling to share grace with the bearer of his heavenly invitation. All heaven rests on accepting God's flawed messenger, and the man turns away.</p>



<p>Do we? There is a 100% chance that all messengers God sends to us will be deeply flawed, too...</p>



<p>A bishop once forgot to show up for the funeral of the child of an immigrant family, forcing the family to carry their unburied child's casket from the locked church in a pouring rain, their guests ungreeted and their grief unshared. It was a sad story of hurt — until the family accepted the bishop's apology, made room for grace, and allowed wounds to heal. [Thomas S. Monsoon, "Hidden Wedges", April 2002. <a href="http://j.mp/356wuRC">http://j.mp/356wuRC</a>]</p>



<p>Which story — Lewis's or the bishop's — has an ending the Lord loves?</p>



<p>So: How do we react to the youth leader who's clumsy or unkind or uninspired with our gay child?</p>



<p>What about the ministering sister who blathers heedlessly on about how delighted she is to be a mother, while our own heart is hurting from childlessness?</p>



<p>What about the apostle who teaches celestial marriage to an audience that includes the reluctantly single, LGBTQ+ members, and people wounded by recent divorce?</p>



<p>The Lord's answer to these questions is very clear, and very consistent, and very challenging. Elder Dale G. Renlund summarized it nicely ["Do Justly, Love Mercy, and Walk Humbly with God", Oct. 2020. <a href="http://j.mp/3obzm72">http://j.mp/3obzm72</a>]:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>Loving mercy means that we do not just love the mercy God extends to us; we delight that God extends the same mercy to others. And we follow His example. 'All are alike unto God,' and we all need spiritual treatment to be helped and healed.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>God knows this is hard. He is patient. He doesn't expect perfection right away. But he does expect us to acknowledge the standard, and to strive for it.</p>



<p>That means that if we find out our Young Women's president was having an affair, we put down our stones; we don't quit in disgust, and we don't publicize a private sorrow. If a leader chides us unjustly, we take the opportunity to practice meekness, swallow the offense, and press forward. If a self-righteous "saint" makes it harder for us to feel accepted, we accept them regardless. Instead of seeing these flawed others as foreigners or pretenders, we see them as our peers, and we do our best to love them like the Man who promised beauty for ashes and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. We see our relationship with covenant brothers and sisters as <em>bigger</em> — more valuable, more multidimensional, more fraught with potential and moral implications — than a few bad memories, or even than a lot of them. We remember what President Uchtdorf taught:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Remember, heaven is filled with those who have this in common: They are forgiven. And they forgive. Lay your burden at the Savior’s feet. Let go of judgment. Allow Christ’s Atonement to change and heal your heart. Love one another. Forgive one another. The merciful will obtain mercy.</p><cite>"The Merciful Obtain Mercy", April 2012. <a href="http://j.mp/2Lf2rQK">http://j.mp/2Lf2rQK</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>And when we do this, the Lord gives us grace in "good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over" (Luke 6:38). This was the experience of concentration camp survivor Corrie ten Boom, who fought and won a silent battle of the soul to share grace:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>It was 1947 and I had come from Holland to defeated Germany with the message that God forgives… ‘When we confess our sins,’ I said, ‘God casts them into the deepest ocean, gone forever. …’</p><p>And that’s when I saw him, working his way forward against the others. One moment I saw the overcoat and the brown hat; the next, a blue uniform and a visored cap with its skull and crossbones. It came back with a rush: the huge room with its harsh overhead lights; the pathetic pile of dresses and shoes in the center of the floor; the shame of walking naked past this man. I could see my sister’s frail form ahead of me, ribs sharp beneath the parchment skin. Betsie, how thin you were!</p><p>Now he was in front of me, hand thrust out: ‘A fine message, Fräulein! How good it is to know that, as you say, all our sins are at the bottom of the sea!’</p><p>And I, who had spoken so glibly of forgiveness, fumbled in my pocketbook rather than take that hand. He would not remember me, of course—how could he remember one prisoner among those thousands of women?...</p><p>‘You mentioned Ravensbruck in your talk,’ he was saying, ‘I was a guard there.’ No, he did not remember me.</p><p>‘But since that time,’ he went on, ‘I have become a Christian. I know that God has forgiven me for the cruel things I did there, but I would like to hear it from your lips as well. Fräulein,’ again the hand came out—’will you forgive me?’</p><p>And I stood there—I whose sins had again and again to be forgiven—and could not forgive. Betsie had died in that place—could he erase her slow terrible death simply for the asking?</p><p>It could not have been many seconds that he stood there—hand held out—but to me it seemed hours as I wrestled with the most difficult thing I had ever had to do.</p><p>For I had to do it—I knew that. The message that God forgives has a prior condition: that we forgive those who have injured us. ‘If you do not forgive men their trespasses,’ Jesus says, ‘neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses.’</p><p>I knew it not only as a commandment of God, but as a daily experience. Since the end of the war I had had a home in Holland for victims of Nazi brutality. Those who were able to forgive their former enemies were able also to return to the outside world and rebuild their lives, no matter what the physical scars. Those who nursed their bitterness remained invalids. It was as simple and as horrible as that.</p><p>And still I stood there with the coldness clutching my heart. But forgiveness is not an emotion—I knew that too. Forgiveness is an act of the will, and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart. ‘… Help!’ I prayed silently. ‘I can lift my hand. I can do that much. You supply the feeling.’</p><p>And so woodenly, mechanically, I thrust my hand into the one stretched out to me. And as I did, an incredible thing took place. The current started in my shoulder, raced down my arm, sprang into our joined hands. And then this healing warmth seemed to flood my whole being, bringing tears to my eyes.</p><p>‘I forgive you, brother!’ I cried. ‘With all my heart!’</p><p>For a long moment we grasped each other’s hands, the former guard and the former prisoner. I had never known God’s love so intensely as I did then. </p><cite>from <em>The Hiding Place</em>; also reprinted in <em>Guideposts</em> magazine in 1972</cite></blockquote>

<p>This year the curriculum for our collective scripture study will be <em>The Doctrine and Covenants</em>. I love this book. It is full of inspired truths and heavenly invitations. And more than any of our other scriptures, we know a lot about the flawed human context that surrounds it. That makes it more precious, more hopeful, more relevant to us — not less.</p>



<p>In its pages we meet a God who patiently reveals things to people who ask clumsy questions, and who are often less than fully worthy of His help. His audience includes the prideful, the impatient, the lazy, the ambitious, the prejudiced, and those who want revenge on their enemies. This is not a God who countenances sin; He commands repentances and warns of the consequences if He is ignored. But He is also merciful beyond our capacity to understand, and He is willing to work with people like Joseph and Brigham and Sidney — and like my ancestors who probably wrestled with their own attitudes toward Joseph's barking dog on Zion's camp. He is the same God who helped Mary wish her stepfather well, and who brought peace to a grieving family wronged by their forgetful bishop, and who overwhelmed Corrie ten Boom with grace.</p>



<p>And because of Him, there's hope for a foolish thrower-of-snowballs like me. </p>
