Today is the 209th anniversary of the birth of Joseph Smith, who founded the church I belong to.

Joseph has always been a controversial figure. Much has been said about him, both good and bad. Joseph predicted this, and with characteristic forthrightness, he admitted how amazing some of his claims must feel to others: "You don’t know me; you never knew my heart. No man knows my history. I cannot tell it: I shall never undertake it. I don’t blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself." (April 7, 1844; <em>History of the Church</em>, vol 6, about page 312)

I said in <a title="What I Believe" href="what-i-believe">another post</a> that I knew Joseph's account about a vision was true--and that the book he translated is true as well.

I stand by that.

I also said that I wished Joseph's critics would spend as much time on the abundant evidence of his goodness as they spend trying to impugn him. He was human and flawed, without question--and I don't feel a need to hide from that. I believe in being true, even when it's messy. But one kind of truth that I want to repeat is this undeniable fact: those who knew him well loved the simple goodness that was deeply ingrained in his character, and they judged him to be worth following.

Here is an example. It comes from Lyman O. Littlefield, the son of one of my ancestors, Waldo Littlefield. Lyman, his brother, and his father participated in a difficult experience called Zion's Camp--a thousand-mile march across the American wilderness at Joseph's behest. At the time, Lyman was a young boy, shy of his 14th birthday, and when he arrived for the march, he had never met Joseph before. Here's what he said (as recorded in Juvenile Instructor, 1892):
<blockquote>As I was then so very young I was naturally enough not made acquainted with the intricate or minute order in which the camp was organized for traveling; but I remember that they were classed into messes of tents for purposes of cooking, washing our clothing, eating, sleeping, etc. While there the men were paraded outside of the camp for exercise and instruction. This was an unpleasant feature for me, as I was too young and too small of stature to act with the men. This created within me, as I remember, some lonesome reflections. I sat down upon a rock where the men were passing, the better to observe their movements. While thus seated, the Prophet Joseph Smith, who happened to be passing by in quite a hurry, noticed me. He stepped to where I sat alone.

It might have been my isolated position that attracted him. I knew not the motive; but that man who to me appeared so good and so godlike, really halted in his hurry to notice me, only a little boy. Placing one of his hands upon my head, he said:"Well, bub, is there no place for you?"

This recognition from the man whom I then knew was a Prophet of God created within me a tumult of emotions. I could make him no reply. My young heart was filled with joy to me unspeakable. He passed on and left me in my lonely attitude, for he was then in quite a hurry to accomplish something pertaining to the movements of the men which could not be delayed.

I mention this circumstance as it illustrates a trait of his character, which in after years he has often been seen to exemplify. He was naturally fond of the young, especially little children. He did not like to pass a child, however small, without speaking to it. He has been known to actually cross a street if he saw a child alone on the opposite side, to speak to it or to inquire if it had lost its way.

These little acts of human sympathy were prompted by those innate qualities planted in his heart which rendered it so easy and natural for him to be ever prompt in administering kindness and rendering aid to all who chanced to move within his accustomed rounds of life. He was not only kind and gentle to the youth, but the aged he treated with the respect due their
whitened locks; and their tottering limbs could ever find ready and willing support on his strong arm, ever prompt to lead them to the place where inclination or duty called for their presence.

The proud men of the earth may not bend their stubborn dignity to such simple acts of kindness; the monarch may not deign to grant a nod of recognition to the courtiers at the precincts of his throne; the blood- stained conqueror may not award any token of gratitude to the warrior who won his battles; the wily usurper may turn coldly from the men who made his schemes for advancement a success; men with adamantine hearts may exist in the higher walks of life, even where civilization boasts of refinement, and humanity is boastful.

These things have been placed upon the records of the world, in history of ambitious, sordid and selfish man; but such traits of character formed no portion of the election of the man who, from kindly prompting, touched with his open palm my youthful head at the highway side when the bustling scenes of Zion's Camp were in progress.

Thus I have made allusion to my first introduction to an acquaintance with Joseph Smith, the God-chosen Prophet of the nineteenth century. In my estimation he was good and great, and even one of God's noblemen. My subsequent acquaintance with him proved to me that my first estimate of his true character was not too highly formed.</blockquote>
I used to be an insecure teenager, myself--plus I am currently an assistant scoutmaster, and I have four boys of my own. I think I know something about the heart of scrawny, anxious 13- and 14-year-olds. And I think I could like a man who stops and talk to them, just to be nice.
