		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm just an ordinary guy with opinions and questions. I don't claim to have all the answers.

<img class="alignright wp-image-40 size-full" style="margin-left:1em;" src="http://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/me.jpg" alt="me" width="200" height="333" />I do, however, have lots of thoughts and feelings about spirituality and religion, and this site is my way of sharing them. Such things matter to me a lot--and this is the best way I've found to say something permanent and meaningful about them.

I don't expect to write often--I have oodles of other things demanding my attention, and I'm sure you do, too--but occasionally I feel strongly about stuff that's happening in popular culture or in my personal life. When I do, I'll see if I can squeeze out a post.

If you know me or you spend any significant time here, you'll be aware that I am a Mormon. I was a <a href="http://sivanea.com/2013/02/17/they-trickle-salty/">missionary years ago on the Mexican border</a>. I have a <a href="http://www.mormon.org/me/1PH2">profile on mormon.org</a> where I comment about specific church culture and doctrine.

I like to write. I post short stories and poetry on <a href="http://sivanea.com">sivanea.com</a>, and I've published some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Hardman/e/B00AOOGF9M">books</a> as well. I also maintain a tech blog at <a href="http://codecraft.co">codecraft.co</a>.

I have a wonderful wife and seven fascinating and unique children, and I live in Utah.

You can use the "<a title="Contact" href="http://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/contact/">Contact</a>" page to send me an email, or you can look me up on social media. All my links are posted at <a href="http://about.me/daniel.hardman">http://about.me/daniel.hardman</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is no accident that <em>The Book of Mormon</em> begins with a story about a family. And folks, this is not a Mormon fairytale family, with neatly groomed children raptly clustered around joyful parents leading a Family Home Evening in a spotless living room, while choirs of angels provide background music.

[caption id="" align="alignright" width="327"]<a href="https://www.lds.org/media-library/images/nephi-subdues-rebellious-brothers-39641?category=gospel-art/book-of-mormon&amp;lang=eng"><img class="" src="http://media.ldscdn.org/images/media-library/gospel-art/book-of-mormon/nephi-subdues-rebellious-brothers-39641-gallery.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="447" /></a> Nephi Subdues His Rebellious Brothers, by Arnold Friberg; 1 Nephi 17:15–55.[/caption]

In the first few pages we read about pride and bitterness among siblings, a generation gap, broken-hearted parents, wayward and ungrateful children, a lonely single man, and a distant relative addicted to drink and consorting with evil friends in shadowy nightlife. Keep reading, and you’ll find verbal and physical abuse, arguments about money, sons in danger on deployment, depression, death of elderly parents, childbearing in near-starvation conditions, reluctant moves to unfamiliar places, lazy and dishonest husbands, several attempted murders, and a wild, immoral party. And we aren’t even out of 1st Nephi yet!

Now, that might seem like a sensationalized list, but I offer it to make a point: <em>The Book of Mormon</em> was written for our day. The Lord cares about our families. He cares that we feel desperate and overwhelmed, that we have private sorrows. Maybe your neighbor doesn’t know what it’s like to have a spouse who’s struggling with pornography, or to be childless, or to be lonely and single, or to agonize with same-sex attraction, or to ache over wayward children, or to fight mental or emotional illness every hour of every day, or to grind through unemployment and financial ruin with no obvious sunshine on the horizon, or to watch a loved one suffer with a terminal illness.

But <i>He</i> does.

And, incredible as it may sound, that book of books--the one that talks so much about tough family problems--is not a downer! Nephi reports that he lived “after the manner of happiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">2 Ne 5:27</a>). Despite his troubles, he finds joy and comfort in an atoning, compassionate Savior that can heal his heart and his family in ways he does not understand. “Nevertheless,” he says, “I know in whom I have trusted” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.19?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">2 Ne 4:19</a>). <i>That</i> is the topic of every lesson in every Sunday School class, no matter who’s teaching and what the name of the class is.

Think of the other family stories that the Editor with a capital E inserted in <em>The Book of Mormon</em>. Enos repents because of the words of his father. Abish, lonely and surrounded by wordliness, clings to the faith and the testimony of her youth and emerges triumphant. Alma rebels, but is rescued by a God so loving and compassionate that even hearts as hard as stone are melted. Lamoni’s father stops attacking a missionary and accepts the gospel in his old age. Corianton forsakes a life of immorality and becomes a dedicated missionary. A Lamanite queen holds vigil by the bedside of a husband in a coma. Sons love and trust their mothers so much that they risk their lives with perfect faith in childhood teachings. Mormon worries about his son growing up in a world of encroaching darkness and evil...

I find it so very encouraging that when the Lord put together a book about families, He filled it with stories my own family can relate to...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I recently fasted that I could take better care of my body. I decided to exercise consistently, and I also decided not to eat after 8 pm. I am also trying hard to get to bed early. Yet last night I had a bout of insomnia and was up till 3 am. Sean had been out late and came in the door very late (around 2:00, maybe?). He was quite cheerful, and he offered me a doughnut from a box he was carrying. He was so cheerful and willing to interact — and that was so delightful — that I immediately accepted. Later, he put the box of leftover doughnuts on the counter for anyone to grab, and I went and had another one.</p>



<p>Obviously, those weren't great successes with my eating or my bedtime goals. This was on my mind this morning when I knelt (much later than usual) to say prayers. I told the Lord that I was discouraged about my lack of success, and as I pondered my concern and my words, the Spirit taught me something.</p>



<h2>Impressions</h2>



<p>Principles are not all of equal importance. Living in perfect harmony with a principle (for example, "don't eat after 8 pm" or "retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary") does not mean aligning to that principle in all circumstances; rather, it means putting that principle in its proper perspective such that our actions embody it appropriately.</p>



<p>Principles vary in their generality. For example, the narrow principle "don't eat after 8 pm" is a specific incarnation of the more general principle, "take care of your body," which in turn derives from several even broader principles such as "be grateful" and "be a wise steward over valuable resources" and "take joy in good and beautiful things." The broader a principle, the more relevant it is to many different contexts. Breadth is not a measure of importance, exactly; it is more a measure of a principle's potential scope for blessing us when applied appropriately.</p>



<p>The Spirit kindled some of this light in my mind and then prompted me to enumerate some cases where I would eat after 8 pm even though I was aligned with the principle of not doing so. I thought it through and came up with examples like this:</p>


<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>I haven't eaten for a long time and have missed dinner — it is after 8 but I am ravenously hungry.</li><li>I am a guest in someone's home later in the evening. They offer me food, and I feel it's better to accept the hospitality than to demur.</li><li>I am traveling and my sense of time or timezones gets distorted.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->


<p>The Spirit taught me to think about these situations not as exceptions or lapses, but rather as cases where a different principle (for example, the principle of being a courteous guest) is more important and thus overrides or governs. Just as background-color brushstrokes get covered with the strokes of foreground shapes as a painting matures in complexity and beauty, principles can come to the foreground in certain places, overriding other background context that is true but not primary there. When this happens, it is not as if the other principle is abandoned or unloved or violated. There is no imperfection to repent of. Rather, there is a correct priority manifesting.</p>



<p>Grappling with and learning from this phenomenon is a major purpose of life. Opposition in all things is not just about temptation or flaws or a fallen world; it is about understanding that there are competing principles, and we need to learn when and why we should prioritize one over another. Some principles are good, solid truths that ought to form the basis of behavior for any rational, self-interested being (for example, taking care of our bodies). Other principles have higher stakes, which makes them even more profound and beautiful, and thus gives them the potential to override (for example, keeping a covenant, even at the risk of physical danger).</p>



<p>Some principles are inviolate. God is not willing to ever override or obscure them. Among these are justice, mercy, agency, and truth. God is not willing to let something trump justice. Neither is He willing to water down mercy from its maximum scope — not even one little bit. God is not willing to abrogate agency in the slightest degree. And He is a God of truth who cannot lie. Period.</p>



<p>Inviolate principles are like load-bearing supports at the base of a building. Just as you can't remove a burdened pillar without endangering the structure that rests upon it, you can't remove or weaken an inviolate principle without destabilizing the whole structure of eternity and reality. Nor can one principle replace another. All such principles must carry their full load, to perfection.</p>



<p>Undergirding, beautifying, endowing, informing, and motivating the totality of the universe is the great "why" that ties all these principles together — the thing that gives them purpose and coherence and grandeur and light. This is charity, which is the greatest principle of all.</p>



<p>A universe without charity would be bleak and black. Yes, there could be truth — but it would be empty. Yes, there could be agency — but there could be no happiness. Yes, there could be justice — but there could be no hope. And so forth.</p>



<p>Charity does not trump inviolate principles; rather, charity is what <em>demands</em> that these principles be inviolate. It says, "Out of all possible universes, which one best embodies the irresistible abundance of love that demands its perfect work?" And, having answered that question, charity then derives the shape and structure of the universe from that first principle. Charity demands truth, because only truth will provide a correct basis for organizing in a sea of other, lesser principles. Charity demands agency, because it recognizes that totalizing the universe shrinks it. Charity demands justice — a universe fully governed by law — so structure is even possible. Charity demands mercy, because a Being of Love must be allowed to exercise His or Her own agency to inject grace to create beauty and light and joy.</p>



<p>Charity puts all of the other principles in their proper places as well. This is why it is correct to accept food from a host after 8 pm, even though I'm trying to stop eating late at night: charity tells me that being a courteous guest is the more important principle in that situation.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:right;">(previously published in <a href="http://www.ldsmag.com/article/1/12755"><em>Meridian Magazine</em></a>)</p>
During the 2012 presidential campaign, I ran across an online magazine article about LDS garments. The comment stream after the article was predictably busy. One thread raised the age-old question of whether the temple ceremony, garments, and related topics are “sacred” or “secret”. Latter-day saints prefer “sacred”; many outside the church consider this a disingenuous splitting-of-hairs. One commenter said something like, “Well, if you can’t talk about it, it’s by definition a secret.”

I think I understand why someone would feel the way this commenter did. Although the distinction is familiar in LDS culture<sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup>, and is more than mere wordplay, it is not something that we explain very well.

Perhaps the following will help.

The undiscussed details of temple matters bear a strong resemblance to another circumstance that people of all backgrounds readily understand: happily married couples are reluctant to discuss the details of their physical intimacy with others. What happens between them is not supposed to be a deep, dark secret--in fact, the set of people aware of what physical intimacy entails is unbounded, and as the set grows, it does not cheapen or threaten the couple. But out of respect for each other, and to preserve the integrity of the bond that unites them, that aspect of their lives is not shared--even with others who are similarly informed. It is sacred territory; casual travel cheapens it.

Similarly, members of the LDS church are taught that some aspects of the temple experience should not be shared. Those matters are intended to have sacred, personal meaning, explorable only between an individual and God, who works in our minds and hearts through His Spirit.

It is important to understand that this standard does not just preclude discussing temple matters with the uninitiated--it also precludes discussing them with one’s spouse, closest friends, or church leaders, even if such people are thoroughly aware of the details of temple ordinances themselves. The temple experience is between you and God; no other parties get a seat at the table. It is simply none of their business.

Describing temple matters as a “secret” conveys a certain amount of truth, but it fails to capture the essence. I think that’s why Mormons often fall back to the “sacred” versus “secret” distinction. There is no requirement to actively prevent others from learning information about the temple--only a commitment not to be personally responsible for cheapening it. LDS scholar Hugh Nibley put it this way:
<blockquote>… The important thing is that I do not reveal these things; they must remain sacred to me. I must preserve a zone of sanctity which cannot be violated. … For my covenants are all between me and my Heavenly Father.”<sup>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup></blockquote>
Consider the parallel with physical intimacy.

Some things can be said. In temple ordinances, we commit ourselves to obey God and to put Him first in our lives. We commit ourselves to absolute fidelity to our spouse. We commit ourselves to strive to do good, to be honest, to live by the scriptures, and to repent and rely on Jesus Christ to save us when our efforts are flawed (as they always are).

It is also possible to make some clear statements about what is not part of the temple experience. There is no unseemly, immoral, or immodest behavior; indeed, nothing could be further from reality. There are no conspiracies, no dark oaths, not subversive plots, no criticisms of people of other faiths.

I suppose a conspiracy theorist could construct an imaginary temple experience that consists of all sorts of vile stuff, and then explain my summary as outright deception required by that evil. To any that might be inclined to this perspective, I am not sure what else I could say. I guess my final suggestion would be that you examine the lives of ordinary LDS women and men that you know, who’ve been through the temple. I’m not talking about the political figures and prominent church leaders and disaffected ex-Mormons and other strident voices out there; I’m talking about the mom who sits next to you at PTA meetings, or the guy who works on your team at the office. Ordinary Mormons make peanut butter sandwiches for their kids, worry about their teenagers getting in car accidents, scrimp and save to pay college tuition, rush to the hospital when Grandma has a stroke, and make as many mistakes living life as anybody else. I’m sure you know that they’re not ideal people, but I hope you also see that many of them are trying to live honorably. Are they secretive and sinister? Do they seem like radical subversives? These are relevant questions, because ordinary LDS people go to the temple and make the commitments entailed by that experience, all the time. Don’t you think their lives would suggest what those commitments are?

Finally, it is worth noting that it is not offensive to Mormons to ask sincere questions. If you want to know something about the temple experience, do not assume that you’ll be stonewalled at every turn if you broach the subject. Just ask. Many temple-related topics have straightforward answers that have been published for general audiences. If the question is not something we feel comfortable answering, we’ll tell you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have wanted for a long time to say something to my friends and loved ones about my religious worldview. I understand that many prefer to avoid such topics; I won’t be offended if you tune me out rather than continuing to read. But I hope you’ll give me a few minutes.
<h3>Motivation<a name="motivation"></a></h3>
My goal in sharing isn’t to debate, to convince, or to criticize. Rather, I want to put my beliefs on record because they matter to me. They are part of who I am, and you can’t truly know me without understanding how--or why--I feel about this topic. I also find that perspectives like mine, where faith is central, are caricaturized in public discourse. This might lead some to think that nobody rational would feel the way I do. I disagree. If people dislike or reject what I believe, that’s their privilege, of course--but I wish such disagreement could proceed from real understanding, rather than flawed assumptions. So many unfortunate outcomes start with the false premise that we understand another person without listening to them...

<!--more-->

I hope my thoughts offer encouragement to folks with a similar perspective, and provide fodder for pondering, for my friends who see things differently. I am happy to engage in kind and sincere dialog about what I say here, if you like. Just drop me a line on the "<a title="About" href="http://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/about/">Contact</a>" page, or leave a comment.
<h3>What Unites Us<a name="what-unites"></a></h3>
Let me start by acknowledging common ground. How we make sense of the world, and how we frame our ethical choices, is a delicate subject. We all have different life circumstances, and we filter them through unique personalities. I know people whose morality and aspirations resemble my own in important ways, but whose lenses differ. Many espouse a strain of Christianity. Some are atheist or agnostic; a few are Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, Wiccan, Buddhist, undecided... It is remarkable to me how congruent our ethical principles can be, given the diversity of our backgrounds; I consider such harmony an important evidence of undergirding Truth. The imperative to love our neighbor, for example, isn’t just a nifty moral aphorism--it expresses a truth about human nature and what you might call a “resonance” to which our universe is attuned. We all feel it, as the #KindnessBoomerang clip so beautifully demonstrates:

http://youtu.be/nwAYpLVyeFU

I honor all people who seek to do good, live their ideals, and put their their faith to work making the world a better place. The world is full of them. I am grateful that we get to rub shoulders.
<h3>Beginnings<a name="beginnings"></a></h3>
As with many others, my story of faith starts in childhood. I was raised by parents who have strong convictions about God. They are intelligent people, well educated and curious. They are deeply kind. They have integrity, which they have maintained through hard, hard experiences. Both of them would be quick to agree that they are also flawed, which puts them in the same camp as the rest of us. :-) I don’t believe that their faith makes them more worthwhile or special than anybody else, and they don’t, either. However, from the dawn of memory, I observed that my parents’ core beliefs gave them hope; stretched them to serve and sacrifice beyond their comfort zone; and exposed, compensated for, and partially corrected many of their foibles and mistakes. Because of this, I have never doubted the value of faith. Long and intimate experience makes me certain that, when held and followed with sincerity, faith blesses lives.
<h3>One Competing View<a name="one-competing-view"></a></h3>
Of course, my parents’ perspective isn’t the only one I know. I was raised with full access to popular culture, with its cacophony of opinions. I’ve pondered alternative attitudes to faith almost as long as I’ve pondered the one my parents encouraged, so I’d like to mention some of those ideas in passing.

One perspective says that religion is a net negative--the “opiate of the masses,” or worse. Self-deluding, Bible-thumping hypocrites are an archetype in popular media. Bigots are (rightfully) decried. It’s fashionable to point to crusades, jihads, holocausts, pogroms, and wars of papal succession as evidence that religion does more harm than good.

I don’t disagree with the lament that organized religion--or even just “faith”--can be intertwined with unhappy situations. However, I find these types of critique uninsightful. They proceed from the assumption that there are essential differences between faith and all other deeply held worldviews, as if only religion depends on axioms. And they focus on belief rather than ethically repugnant decision-making as the seed of evil.

Yes, hypocrisy is a problem. However, its preconditions are satisfied by any situation where power is vested in humans; politics and parenting and the legal arena furnish lots of obvious examples.

Yes, some bigotry and narrow-mindedness is cloaked in religion. But its wardrobe also includes ethnic groups, social classes, academia, and any other strata where willful ignorance and enmity can flourish. I find it significant that great champions of tolerance--Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr, Mother Theresa, and the Dalai Lama come to mind--seem to be people both driven and enabled by their faith.

Yes, history is replete with events where religion is used to frame horrific choices. However, this is evidence of the depths to which human nature can sink, and of the insidiousness of the lies we tell ourselves--not of fundamental flaws in a humble religious compass. Who was the authentic devotee--the cardinal who reveled in his wealth, or Hugo’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Myriel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bishop Myriel</a>, cheerfully trading candlesticks to rescue a lost soul? Who were the sincere believers--Nazis, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrie_ten_Boom">Corrie</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsie_ten_Boom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betsie ten Boom</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham Joshua Heschel</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viktor Frankl</a>?

<h3>Not Believing By Default<a name="not-by-default"></a></h3>
Having defended religious faith in the abstract, and lauded my parents in particular, I don’t want you to think that I believe what I do, just because I had a strong and mostly happy upbringing where religion mattered. I did not thoughtlessly adopt the beliefs that my parents offered me, simply on the grounds that their path seemed praiseworthy. I am on my own journey, and I have a higher bar for faith than that. It is vital to me that I arrive at my beliefs honestly, without self-deception or narrow-mindedness.

I read the Bible all the way through for the first time at about age 14. I soon followed this with a serious exploration of <a href="http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/book-of-mormon" target="lds"><em>The Book of Mormon</em></a> and other scriptures associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I have also read the entire <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, and dabbled in the <em>Koran</em> and <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> and the <em>Mahabharata </em>and the <em>Dhammapada</em>. I’ve poked at the <em>Popol Vuh</em> and <em>Book of the Dead</em>, formally studied Greek and Norse mythology, and read more casually about other sacred traditions. I devoured C.S. Lewis and took summer school classes from Catholic nuns. I have attended Catholic mass, some charismatic Christian churches, and an African Methodist Episcopal service--and have positive things to say about all of them. I have spent hours discussing beliefs with Baptists, atheists, Native Americans, Muslims, and others.

I don’t claim that this makes me an expert on religious topics--not even close. My point is simply that I haven’t been insular, and I have tried to learn.

Besides the “religion is evil” attitude that I already mentioned, I have encountered many other schools of thought that directly or indirectly challenge faith: nihilism and existentialism, psychology, amateur rock-and-roll philosophers. :-) I love science; in addition to a heavy dose in college, I bought a copy of <em>Origin of Species</em>, watched all of <em>Cosmos</em>, and thoroughly enjoyed <em>A Brief History of Time</em>. I’ve read Joseph Campbell’s <em>Hero With a Thousand Faces</em>, plus other scholarly texts on anthropology and linguistics. About the same time I finished the Bible, I read a thick paperback published by anti-Mormon authors who were anxious that I not believe a bunch of hokum. Since then, I’ve read <em>Rough Stone Rolling</em> (an exhaustive history of Joseph Smith by a professor of history at Columbia), as well as other texts that explicitly challenge my own worldview.
<h3>First-Hand Experience<a name="first-hand-experience"></a></h3>
Out of this chaotic tapestry of ideas and philosophies, faith is my choice. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and I intend to stay there. I find this choice to be a source of peace and joy, and I find that my faith harmonizes profoundly with the truths that I perceive in science and in other philosophical or religious traditions. Interpreting life through my faith doesn’t answer every question; indeed, it raises some important ones that I might otherwise ignore. However, the answers that I get are genuine and incredibly satisfying, and the questions that remain are ones I am content to patiently ponder.

Of the many experiences that led me to a faith in God, the one that initially made the most impact, and that has remained pivotal in intervening years, happened when I was a teenager. I was saying a prayer at bedtime, and I had an overwhelming and unexpected sense that my prayer was receiving the full attention, and tender response, of a person--a Father--who loved me and understood me perfectly. I could spend hours trying to put more about that experience into words, but I’m certain the result would not do the event justice, and perhaps such sacred moments are intended to be highly personal anyway.

The context of this experience is important. I was a busy and self-centered fifteen-year-old, preoccupied with tomorrow’s load of homework and a part-time job that I was neglecting. I was not a bad kid, but I was no paragon, either. I approached the prayer as the last item on a to-do list. It was what I had to finish before I could finally drift off to sleep. I don’t remember what I said to begin my prayer; I probably mumbled and rushed, and what I said was probably formulaic. I was not seeking anything. I wasn’t planning to pour out my heart. I was simply satisfying a habit that seemed worthwhile.

The response that I received was infinitely out of proportion to my request. What I learned in those moments of connection is that God is real. He has an incredibly personal interest in each of us as individuals. He is not an artifact of wishful thinking, and He is not just a cosmic ideal or an impersonal beneficence of some sort.

A skeptic would have many questions about this experience. How could I “know” anything, just from some feelings? Was I just willing myself into an emotional frenzy? Was I hallucinating? Was I just projecting a childhood imagination of God onto random firing of neurons in my brain--neurons that I carried because my distant ancestors got some evolutionary advantage from magical thinking and superstition? Why would God allow me such an experience, when others having a sincere desire report no parallel? How could God be the kind of being I describe, if life is so full of misery for so many?

These are perfectly reasonable questions, and I have spent nearly 30 years thinking about them. I have some tentative answers. But I am not the slightest bit tentative on this much: the experience was real. <strong>I know God exists.</strong> The love and intimate connection I felt from Him are essential aspects of His character.
<h3>Knowing<a name="knowing"></a></h3>
Before I get more specific about what else I believe in, I feel like I need to take a detour to talk about the word “know.” I have heard some who don’t like the way I just used it, when I said “I know God exists.” They want all such statements to be backed by careful epistemology, by independently verifiable experiments.

I get that. I agree that the scientific method matters, and I have no love for sloppy thinking.

However, if we asked a philosopher or scientist how they “know” that their mother loved them, truthful answers would show that we human beings don’t always work quite so simply. Sometimes we arrive at knowledge through first-hand personal experience, and that is as it should be. Dismissing such knowledge as “anecdotal” or “subjective” is a dangerous and disingenuous trivialization.

We also reason from what we know--and when our reasoning feels particularly strong, we say we “know” our conclusions. I “know” that the Great Red Spot exists on Jupiter, though I have never personally observed it. I “know” that the dodo bird once existed, even though no first-hand evidence is available to me. I “know” that the sun will come up tomorrow. No experiment can prove this; I suppose it’s conceivable that a horrific weapon from some undiscovered alien enemy could cause Sol to nova while I’m sleeping tonight. But I still “know.”

This leads me to Occam’s Razor. So-called rationalists love to talk about this principle (which I would loosely characterize as: the simplest explanation that fits all the facts, or the explanation that posits the fewest new assumptions, is usually the correct one). Some say that Occam’s Razor requires them to discard superstition--by which they mean ideas like sin, a creator, prophets, life after death, and angels--as pure nonsense.

I think Occam’s Razor is a useful insight--but it is not an iron-clad law. Sometimes, we need to make new assumptions because our existing mental model is inadequate. The leap from Newtonian physics to relativity, and the leap from relativity to quantum mechanics, come to mind...

Occam’s Razor cuts both ways. The simplest explanation for billions of human beings claiming to have had important experiences with deity is that they’re reporting a reality. The simplest explanation for <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/john/6.5-13#4" target="lds">five loaves and two fishes feeding five thousand people</a> is that it really happened. That we don’t understand <em>how</em> seems much more likely to me than the idea that a carpenter from Nazareth was a consummate magician, or that such a huge crowd suffered a mass delusion, or that apostles invented the story and inserted it in the historical record with no contradicting witnesses.
<h3>What Occam's Razor Teaches Us</h3>
Importantly, I don’t think I’ve ever heard anybody wrestle with <em>why</em> Occam’s Razor should be such a good guideline. Why should it? There is no law that says it must be so. I work with computers for a living, and I see software get more and more complicated as it tries to correctly model more of what goes on in the systems it regulates. So why should human thought work the opposite way--where simpler is more likely to be right?

I think it’s because the human mind is particularly analogous to, or congruent with, the natural order of the universe. Speaking of the idea that logic should be capable of explaining natural phenomena, Harvard philosophy professor Charles Sanders Peirce said:
<blockquote>I hear you say, ‘This smacks too much of an anthropomorphic conception.’ I reply that every scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is a hypothesis that there is something in nature to which the human reason is analogous; and that it really is so, all the successes of science in its applications to human convenience are witnesses. They proclaim that truth over the length and breadth of the modern world. (1.316)</blockquote>
In other words, science is founded on the idea that the human mind is analogous to nature, and science progresses by revealing new ways that this is true. (By the way, this explains another profound question, which is why, in the scientific method, we should be so astonishingly good at forming a hypothesis. The scientific method calls for observation, a hypothesis to explain it, and experimentation to prove or disprove the hypothesis, but says nothing useful about how to form a hypothesis. That part of the process is pure magic, yet it works surprisingly well!)

In all of nature, why should the human mind, specifically, exhibit this congruence? Chimpanzees and cockroaches and killer whales and <em>Escherichia coli</em> have all been evolving just as long as human beings, yet do not have minds that hypothesize as correctly, with nearly the scope of the human mind, about the universe--so you can’t claim that time induces evolution into resonance with predictive power. You can’t claim that evolutionary success explains it; cockroaches had a winning design long before we did.

For me, an interesting answer is suggested by the Bible’s assertion that humanity was created in God’s image. If the universe manifests His handiwork, and we are in some limited sense like the Creator--more so than other creations--then it would make sense for mental models that demand less mental gymnastics from human beings to have greater predictive power, on the whole. The rightness of Occam’s Razor itself is thus suggested by theology--but I see no satisfying explanation otherwise. Again quoting Peirce:
<blockquote>In the light of the success of science to my mind there is a degree of baseness in denying our birthright as children of god and shamefacedly slinking away from anthropomorphic conceptions of the universe." (ibid)</blockquote>
I don’t want to make too much of this. I’m not claiming this is any kind of proof of anything. I just think it’s worth pondering.

There are certainly sincere and intelligent people who are agnostics or atheists or believers of other stripes, and I concede the rationality of many. However, I don’t concede that rationality and intellectual courage is any group’s exclusive territory--as if the rest of us are necessarily foolish or stupid or self-deluded. All of us arrive at our beliefs influenced by a combination of reason, experience, and desires. Note “all” and “desires” in that sentence; omitting either word is dishonest.

Therefore, I don’t accept the claim that science or philosophy or Occam’s Razor forces me to discount God if I’m rational. I have compelling reasons to believe in Him--the experience I previously described, plus many others that are less dramatic. I conclude from the evidence that I know He is real. Could I explain the evidence in other ways? I suppose I could try. But doing so would not be an act of honesty or courage; instead, it would be a betrayal of something beautiful and personal and real, and it would be motivated by desires (pride and convenience, perhaps) that my better self rejects.

I’m not condemning anybody who takes a different approach. I will never know enough to judge the equations that drive other people. But I do think that if we prefer to conceptualize with ideas like faith, repentance, and moral absolutes, we can--and we can end up with a coherent system that jives with science. If we begin with different axioms, such as the idea that life and intelligence can spontaneously arise where it did not exist before, and that natural law derives from chance, we can also construct a certain sort of harmony. The main difference between these approaches is not rationality--it’s how the systems explain our meaning and moral imperatives as human beings. In the end, belief is more of a moral choice than an intellectual status.
<h3>What Else I Know<a name="what-else-i-know"></a></h3>
Since the day of my intensely personal encounter with God, I have had many other spiritual experiences. I have felt answers to simple prayers arrive as feelings of reassurance, courage, hope, and comfort. I have had good ideas flow into my mind. I have been reminded of the value of others--if God loves them, how can I treat them with anything less than respect? I have seen, clearly, how I need to change my life to do a better job of fulfilling God’s plans for me. I have been prompted to repent.

These things feed my faith.

A few of my beliefs are sufficiently strong now that they rise to the level of “knowing” in the same way, and to the same degree, that I know that God is real. <strong>I know that Jesus is divine</strong>, and that <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/none-were-with-him?lang=eng" target="lds">He performed an atonement</a> that made it possible for us to become clean and to live again. I have had repeated experiences--countless numbers of them--that confirm this truth to me. These are not just experiences of religious rapture where the orchestra swells like the soundtrack in a Hollywood movie, and people all around me trumpet about the Spirit. They include quiet moments of loneliness or despair when I have received unlooked-for and undeserved hope from outside myself; moments when I have been taught or sobered or admonished in ways I had been incapable of understanding on my own; moments when I felt peace; moments when things made sense so deeply that I can never forget. This core doctrine of Christianity is called “the gospel,” which means “the good news.” And it <em>is</em> good news--not a minor headline fit for the lifestyle section of the paper, but <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.3-5?lang=eng#2" target="lds">THE GOOD NEWS!</a> worthy of the boldest front-page headline we can muster. I love the <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11.5?lang=eng#4" target="lds">gospel of grace</a>.

Because of what I know about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and because I have spent many hours studying over decades, <strong>I know that the scriptures are true</strong> as well. They were written, translated, and published by flawed people, and there is undoubtedly evidence of those flaws in the pages--in all scripture, ancient and modern. <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/morm/8.17#16" target="lds">Moroni anticipated this</a> about his own output, and he was right. Occasionally I’ll stumble across a passage that says X soldiers died in battle, and a later passage that says Y people died--or I’ll read something that reveals a cultural bias against women, or an assumption that the world ends at the edges of the Mediterranean. These sorts of things are unfortunate, but they don’t destroy my faith. I am not a literalist who thinks “six days” means exactly 518,400 seconds. The heart of the scriptures is a fervent testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ, and about that message, scriptures are remarkably consistent with one another and with my own separately acquired knowledge. In particular, I am grateful for the <a href="https://www.lds.org/media-library/video/2011-10-055-the-prodigal-son?category=bible-videos-the-life-of-jesus-christ&amp;lang=eng" target="lds">account of Jesus' ministry</a> that comes to us through the New Testament, and I love <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32-33#31" target="lds">the plain, powerful witness of The Book of Mormon</a>.

<strong>I also know that <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1#10" target="lds">Joseph Smith’s account of a vision</a>, and of divine help as he translated <em>The Book of Mormon</em>, are true.</strong> Again, I am setting a high bar for using the word “know” here. About this truth I have also had many, many confirming experiences.

I don’t know everything about Joseph’s life and heart. I am familiar with much about his public history, including both good and bad. (Funny how critics only want to discuss the latter…). In private, <a href="https://www.lds.org/liahona/1978/12/joseph-smith-prophet-of-kindness" target="lds">some of his actions were magnificent</a>--almost breathtakingly courageous and humble and generous. We know a few details from journals and anecdotes. But that’s not the whole story, I suppose. Joseph may have been as flawed as Moses, who not only parted the Red Sea but also killed an Egyptian under complex circumstances and hid him in the sand, and whose wife called him a “bloody husband.” He may have been as flawed as Jonah, who preached to Nineveh, but only after fleeing to avoid offering a hated ethnic group a chance to repent. It is clear that on numerous occasions, he was woefully misunderstood and viciously maligned. Perhaps reality is a mixture of all of the above, and perhaps the Lord hasn’t clarified because his private life isn’t really public business. But whatever else Joseph was, he was most certainly a tool of the Lord, someone who courageously accomplished a vital mandate at the cost of excruciating personal sacrifice. I am grateful. I love him for that.

The attitude of Mormons toward Joseph Smith is often misunderstood or misrepresented, so I want to be very clear about this particular topic: Joseph was a man. I don’t worship him. I have never prayed to him, and I find that idea as ludicrous and offensive as he would. I don’t capitalize pronouns that refer to him. I have no doubt that he made lots of mistakes; he said so himself. Weeks go by when I don’t think of him at all. Occasionally I sing hymns about him; always, the lyrics express gratitude that the work he did draws us more fully and fervently toward Christ. Joseph himself said it best:
<blockquote>The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.” (TPJS 121)</blockquote>
The church Joseph founded isn’t Joseph’s church, and he isn’t at the center of its doctrine; like all the other supporting details, Joseph is only an appendage to the core Topic-with-a-capital-T.

The same is true of all the other personalities and policies and imperfections in the historical and contemporary church. Do I know about them? Mostly, yes. What do I make of them? Given the flawed material that God has to work with (us humans), I find nothing astonishing in it, except the successes and the goodness. And whatever else may be said about such topics, it is important to remember that they are not the Heart of the matter, either.

The last thing that fits into the “known” and not merely “believed” category for me is the reality of the divine calling of the prophet leading the Church of Jesus Christ today. I met Ezra Taft Benson and spoke to him one-on-one for a minute or two when he was the prophet; I felt an electrifying sense of his mantle. I listened to his counsel for years, and although I didn't always agree with things he had done and said during his political career, I was always moved by his spiritual counsel. His <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride" target="lds">unforgettable talk about pride</a> is a wonderful example. Here was a man who was carrying out a divine mandate, with God’s whole-hearted approval. I’ve had similar experiences about <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2007/10/slow-to-anger?lang=eng" target="lds">Gordon B. Hinckley</a>, <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/04/be-of-good-cheer?lang=eng" target="lds">Thomas S. Monson</a>, and <a href="https://www.lds.org/broadcasts/article/christmas-devotional/2018/12/four-gifts-that-jesus-christ-offers-to-you?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russell M. Nelson</a>. <strong>I know they were/are prophets.</strong>

<h3>What Else I Believe<a name="what-else-i-believe"></a></h3>
So: I’ve identified a few things that I know. You’ll notice that it’s not a long list. That’s accurate. Most of the rest of my religious beliefs are just that--beliefs that I hold fast because they are in harmony with that bedrock; beliefs that I examine and polish from different angles as the years go by; beliefs that I might not understand exactly right, yet.

<strong>I believe in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_My_Father" target="wiki">Heavenly Mother</a></strong> who is the peer and partner of God the Father in all respects. I am certain that She is real. I have had glimpses of her influence, I think. But unfortunately I know less about Her than I would like, so my ideas are tentative. I hope that will change.

<strong>I believe in moral agency.</strong> Every human being who is capable of moral choices is <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27?lang=eng#26" target="lds">irreversibly free</a> to make <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/questionofgod/voices/frankl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choices of import</a>, and we should respect that freedom. How we do so is a gnarly question, at times, given the complexity of competing demands, our imperfect understanding of what people want and need, and our limited capabilities to act as we want. But we should strive to support this value.

<strong>I believe in keeping the commandments</strong> (the ten, and all the others articulated by ancient and modern prophets), though I’ve come to recognize over the years that I’ve understood them and lived them pretty poorly at times. I believe that obedience and humility are higher values than personal actualization--or rather, that ultimate personal fulfillment is impossible without obedience and submission to Someone who is smarter and wiser and more good than we are. I <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/04/obedience-to-law-is-liberty?lang=eng" target="lds">reject the assertion that such obedience surrenders our freedom and identity</a>; instead, it deliberately channels them in a direction we have chosen based on the values we prize most.

<strong>I believe in families</strong>, with all their <a title="The Book of Mormon is about families" href="http://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/the-book-of-mormon-is-about-families/">warts and heartaches</a>. I was blessed with a wonderful heritage, and I acknowledge my debt to forebearers. I believe that the <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation" target="lds">values articulated by the church with respect to families</a> are crucial to our happiness, although I am hoping for additional doctrine to clarify some of my questions.

<strong>I believe in life after death, and in a literal resurrection.</strong> Each of us will one day receive a body that is free of all worldly flaws, not susceptible to disease or death. This puts a great comma at the end of life stories that look pretty bleak to us mortals. I am so glad. As I said earlier, I have a deep conviction about the divinity of Jesus, including His resurrection. <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/04/hopeless-dawn-joyful-morning" target="lds">Believing that He can and will raise others as He raised Himself</a> is a corollary that I accept and repeat with awe.

For good measure, let me throw in that <strong>I also believe in most of what science and history say about how the world works now, and what’s happened here in the past</strong>. That includes the general principles of evolution and cosmology, among others... I think the evidence for this science is compelling. Do I see conflicts between science and some of the other ideas I’ve just espoused? A few, maybe. Far, far less than most debaters in either camp might expect. I could go on all day about why, but I’ll spare you the details. Drop me a note if you’re interested.

You may have noticed my hedge word, “most.” Not all of science is equally solid, of course. Some theories have <a href="https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/the-paradoxes-that-threaten-to-tear-modern-cosmology-apart-d334a7fcfdb6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rough edges or unexplained gaps</a>, and I expect those areas to be refined by honest seekers of truth over time. That’s partly why I hedge.

I also think that science explains less than its fans like to claim. I find little in math or science that encompasses the infinite, and I find lots of assumptions that have no basis other than our own convenience. The true nature of intelligence, an explanation of the mind, a recipe for life, a model that unifies gravity with other fundamental forces, experimental evidence for dark matter, and many other scientific questions continue to elude us; to me, this is indicative of just how limited our views are. I’m not so sure that teleology is always an intellectual sin, and I’m certain that a fully accurate model of the past and present universe would surprise scientists as well as mystics. Just because we haven’t seen something doesn’t mean it’s a crazy superstition.

<strong>I believe that religion doesn’t answer all of our questions, either.</strong> This is not, in my mind, a criticism--rather, it’s an acknowledgement that we see through a glass, darkly, and that expecting a tidy package with no dangling unknowns is not in the cards at present. I am content to walk by faith.

<strong>I believe in the value and potential of other human beings.</strong>

<strong>I believe in tolerance</strong>, and I am doing my best to practice this virtue. However, I think society wrests this value well beyond its proper form. Tolerance means an attitude of patience and graciousness about differences, driven by the recognition that what unites us is greater than what divides us. It doesn’t mean we have to abdicate all moral judgment. You can think that someone is making a bad choice, and you can say so--and still be tolerant. You can even publicly disagree, and exert your personal influence to frustrate agendas that you find morally troubling. I find myself in this position in regards to the industry that generates and distributes pornography, for example. I am opposed to what that industry does. I think it’s offensive and misogynous and horribly destructive. I detest words and actions that advance such a cause. My tolerance manifests in my willingness to engage in civil conversation, to not persecute or ridicule people who believe differently about the issue, to abide by lawful constraints, and to genuinely think of opponents on this issue as people worthy of kindness, not as caricatures. It doesn’t require me to say, “whatever you believe and whatever makes you feel good is okay.” Tolerance requires me not to be obnoxious; it doesn’t require me to acquiesce.

As I said at the beginning of this essay, <strong>I believe there is much good to be found in other worldviews</strong>, and that across all times and all peoples, God has worked through many individuals to further His purposes. I don’t believe Mormons have any special claim on human goodness. People are people, no matter where you look. <strong>I believe God looks on the heart</strong>, loves all of His children, and will reward us according to our true desires rather than artificial criteria.

Having said that, I do think some choices about belief are better and truer than others, and I believe there is no fuller, more satisfying path than the one offered in The Church of Jesus Christ. It gives us opportunities to serve, to sacrifice, to be fellowshipped, to be held accountable, to learn, and to rub shoulders with others in ways that aren't easily matched otherwise. <strong>I believe it offers a unique opportunity to make binding, authoritative covenants</strong>--and that when all is said and done (possibly long after this life), anyone who wants to know God will need to make those covenants, and will in fact be eager to do so. The covenants and the ordinances that embody them are about the most pure and perfect expression of worship and submission to God--and His <a title="Ordinances Are Evidence of God’s Love" href="http://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/ordinances-are-evidence-of-gods-love/">grace-filled reaching toward us</a> with <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1.15?lang=eng#14" target="lds">arms of love</a>--that I can imagine.

I could add hundreds of paragraphs itemizing more stuff in my worldview, but I think the broad sweep of it is apparent now, and I’ve gone on longer than I intended. Thank you for reading through to the end; that’s a tribute to you. :-)

I hope you can sense my sincerity, and my desire to tell the most important truths I know, in the simplest and most straightforward way I can manage. I hope you can relate to some of my feelings. I would be thrilled if something here has kindled feelings in your heart, or has revived memories of your own past that overlap in some way with mine. But regardless, I appreciate your willingness and effort to understand, and I’d be pleased to hear about your beliefs in return, or to explore questions together.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It was great to read your testimony Dan. Very approachable, insightful, and understanding from other perspectives. I hope you don't stop here, I hope you do discuss the gaps with unanswered questions (or unfinished answers). I believe that kind of dialogue leaves us vulnerable, but creates a passion for everyone... whether or not an answer can be found, that kind of soul searching is catching, and seems like a good thing. I am glad you went as involved as you did. Usually we just hear what someone believes, and rarely why someone believes what they do including doubt. It seems strange to me the very letter that most consider as proof that Jefferson wasn't Christian, to me, proves how Christian he was (He was teaching wisdom, not teaching his (nephew?) how to think) "Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear."
 Very insightful, your train of thought was very fluid... felt like I was reading a good book. Thanks!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for reading and commenting, Brett. That quote from Jefferson is really meaty. I agree with the sentiment--that God is not afraid of reason, but rather designs for us to feel after Him and use the reason He gave us to try to understand Him. We can't understand everything that He can, but that doesn't mean we should make no efforts.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I heard a beautiful story about Marjorie Hinckley the other day. A daughter-in-law was worried about traumatizing her son by urging him too emphatically into the water at swimming lessons. She asked Sister Hinckley for advice, and Sister Hinckley said, “Just save the relationship.”</p><p>It seems to me that a moment of kindness and empathy beside the pool is one of those <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2011/04/finding-joy-through-loving-service?lang=eng" target="_blank">flecks of gold that Elder Ballard mentioned</a>. It seems like learning to be kind and hopeful even when it’s hard to <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2009/10/more-diligent-and-concerned-at-home?lang=eng" target="_blank">see the pattern of the brush strokes is what Elder Bednar counseled us to do</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I find myself returning often to this wonderful quote from President Uchtdorf:</p><blockquote><p>[P]lease understand that what you see and experience now is not what forever will be. You will not feel loneliness, sorrow, pain, or discouragement forever. We have the faithful promise of God that He will neither forget nor forsake those who incline their hearts to Him. Have hope and faith in that promise. Learn to love your Heavenly Father and become His disciple in word and in deed. Be assured that if you but hold on, believe in Him, and remain faithful in keeping the commandments, one day you will experience for yourselves the promises revealed to the Apostle Paul: “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” Brothers and sisters, the most powerful Being in the universe is the Father of your spirit. He knows you. He loves you with a perfect love. God sees you not only as a mortal being on a small planet who lives for a brief season—He sees you as His child. He sees you as the being you are capable and designed to become. He wants you to know that you matter to Him.</p><p>--Dieter F.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[April 2013

This past week, a local radio talk show interviewed some women who have been trying to send an organized message of sorts to the leaders of the LDS church, asking that they seriously consider giving the priesthood to women. I have listened to the podcast.

Linda was curious to know what I thought about all of this. She said she’d discussed it with her mother, and I know that in a ladies get-together on my side of the family, the subject also got explored. I have some female relatives that consider themselves feminists, in some sense of the word. I am also aware of some people that I love who have suffered very difficult experiences at the hands of father figures, which has led me to ponder fatherhood and priesthood roles for a long time. Also, I have some children who are black, so the announcement in 1978 that the priesthood could be extended to all worthy male members has a personal significance to me that might never have settled on my heart otherwise.

None of this gives me any special insight, of course; I’m just trying to explain why I felt that it was worth taking an hour to record my thoughts for anybody who’s interested.

<!--more-->The first thing I’d like to say is that I believe any exploration of the role of men and women and priesthood, and of their relationship to God, can be a worthy and uplifting one. I say “can” because I think it is also possible for this area of doctrinal question--or any area, really--to lead people to anger, pride, and criticism. I have vague memories of Sonia Johnson vocally dissenting during sustainings in General Conference; that sort of animus doesn’t seem like a good target. The women on the podcast sounded sincere and humble to me, and the women that I personally know who are interested in this topic are some of the most humble, kind, and faithful people in my life--so I am not voicing my concern as an oblique way to criticize. I am just hoping that in all our discussions, we (myself included) remember that Christ doesn’t want disputations about points of His doctrine; He considers that so antithetical to His way that He warned about it immediately, in his first sermon during a visit to the Nephites (3 Ne 12).

The second thing I’d like to say is that I believe the gospel is still being restored. LDS doctrine teaches us to believe in continuous revelation, but I think we sometimes imagine that the Lord is done revealing <i>doctrines</i>, and that any revelations He gives us in the future will be about points of procedure, or about tactical responses to world conditions. While I expect those kinds of revelations to happen more often than the grandiose doctrine-expanding kind, I also believe that the Lord “will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of God.” Note the “great and important.”

Today, the LDS church has enough core doctrine, and enough clarity about that core doctrine, for any child of our Heavenly Father to be saved. This is a tremendous blessing, and I am deeply grateful for it. However, I must respectfully disagree with anyone who claims that we have answers to <i>every</i> question of substance. We have <i>enough</i> answers to <i>enough</i> of the big questions. But there are many gaps in our understanding. To cite one very simple example, we are taught that “in the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees” (D&amp;C 131:1). The meaning and relationship between these three divisions is never explained. That is what I call an unanswered question. Not having the answer doesn’t prevent me from making good choices in my life, but it is an area where I would like to know more.

There are many, many examples of unanswered questions like these. What is the afterlife like? We know it is a place of rest for the righteous (Alma 41), where they experience much happiness and peace. We know that missionary work takes place there. We have anecdotes that are shared in church, in which a loved one on the other side appears to impart loving advice or to make a request that temple work be done. But there is so much we don’t know. Do we live in the same kind of family units that we have here, with parents and children in a home of some sort? Do people who spoke English on Earth still speak English on the other side, or will I be able to freely converse with ancestors who lived in England a millenium before Shakespeare? How much will the cultural traditions from this earth life carry across? Do people gather for meals? Can they see us as we go about our daily business? Do they have 7 days constituting a week in their calendar? How is age reflected (or not reflected) in the appearance or behavior of spirits?

Hopefully that list is illustrative of my thinking. All of these questions interest me; in asking them, I am motivated by curiosity and an honest desire for more light. I’m not critical of anyone because they don’t have answers for me. I’m not trying to advance a particular worldview, or insisting on an answer that I like. And not all of the questions are of equal importance to me.

I highlight the matter of unanswered questions because I believe the doctrines of gender, priesthood, marriage, and motherhood are prime examples. We know some core things about these topics, but there is much--very much--that we don’t know. I’m not sure why the Lord has not revealed more about them. Perhaps it’s because the world is <i>so far</i> out of whack on these topics that having publicly-taught doctrines that dramatically expand our views would trigger massive persecution or hardship for the faithful. Perhaps it’s because the faithful themselves are not ready or have not lived up to the light we already have. Or perhaps it’s because we, as a body of believers, have not asked enough. Perhaps there are other reasons that nobody knows about but God. And perhaps it’s some combination of all of the above.

I would observe here that I find a profound contrast between the scriptural injunction to ask--as in: “ask, and ye shall receive”-- and the cautionary tale about folks steadying the ark (see 2 Sam 6:6-7 and D&amp;C 85:8). The injunction to ask is one of the most oft-repeated commandments in the scriptures--perhaps <i>the most</i> repeated. The LDS church began because a boy read James 1:5, took courage from James’ promise that the Lord would not upbraid, and obeyed the Lord’s injunction. Repeatedly.

Clearly the Lord wants us to treasure up the words of eternal life in our hearts, and He wants us to ask Him for more light and knowledge. He has promised, repeatedly, that He will respond with a mighty outpouring (see, for example, Joel 2:28 and D&amp;C 121:33).

However, the Lord doesn’t want people to steady the ark. I imagine the salient difference between asking and steadying is that in one case, we are admitting our lack of understanding, and humbly asking for more; in the other case, we are proposing to correct the Lord’s bad management. Perhaps the differences are more subtle or deep.

At any rate, I reason from this that if we, as followers of Christ, would like more light and knowledge about gender, priesthood, marriage, and motherhood, then it would be pleasing to the Lord for us to ask. This asking can be private--personal prayers, fasting, scripture study, or temple pondering all seem like great ideas. It can be more public--perhaps asking the brethren for more doctrinal insight is a good way. I think of letters that I have heard discussed from the pulpit in general conference, in which lonely single sisters pour out their hearts to the brethren about the difficulty of the path they are on. I think of parents writing of how their hearts ache for a son or daughter who struggles with same-sex attraction. These kinds of pleadings from the people are faithful, and I think they will ultimately cause the heavens to shake for our good. On the other hand, sending petitions to the brethren asking them to make a specific change to procedure makes me a bit uncomfortable, because A) I don’t think we have enough clarity about the doctrinal issues involved; B) I think it’s a bit presumptuous for us to make a conclusion about proper policy until we have that doctrinal clarity; C) using public and worldly channels to communicate with leaders the Lord has given us, when more private and less worldly channels could work equally well, feels unnecessarily strident.

I am not criticizing the women that are making these petitions, because I don’t know that any of the concerns I just raised are characteristic of their thinking. It is possible that they are not asking for a policy change, only making a heartfelt petition for further light and knowledge. And it is possible that more private channels would not or have not been effective. If so, then I think it is possible that what they’re doing is appropriate. I am just saying I’m uncomfortable because I can imagine some mindsets where that behavior would be, in my mind, dangerous.

Anyway, that’s a bit of a tangent to the rest of my thoughts on the subject. Back to the heart of it...

In the early days of the church, women sometimes gave blessings. Eliza R. Snow was known as “the prophetess,” I believe. Joseph Smith organized the Relief Society with statements that allude to priesthood. Some cite this as evidence that women exercising the priesthood should be part of the restoration. I think it’s an interesting point, but I don’t think the reasoning is very strong. In the early days of the church, sacrament meetings were sometimes held on weekdays. Baptisms for the dead were done in a river. Wilford Woodruff and his wife Phoebe were rebaptized because they felt a need for spiritual cleansing, and because Phoebe wasn’t feeling well; Wilford notes in his journal that he felt the rebaptisms had been very helpful. I don’t consider any of these practices to be an endpoint of gospel understanding, but rather evidence that the restoration was not yet complete.

The scriptures speak of daughters that prophesy, and attach the title of “prophetess” to a number of faithful women. Deborah served as the political leader of the Israelites, and may have had some religious duties as well. I also consider this data to be interesting, but to have unclear implications.

What I consider by far the most compelling evidence that our doctrine about priesthood may eventually be extended in some respect has to do with the temple. Today, duly called women officiate in portions of priesthood ordinances in the temple. It is hard to characterize that service as anything other than a priestly function--and for those who have been to the temple, I think pondering the verbiage may yield some interesting insights. I find it interesting that the role of women in the temple predates modern feminism, women priests in the episcopal church, and similar thinking by well over a hundred years. The Lord does not need lessons in progressive thinking from the world.

The most profound and mysterious doctrinal questions in the gospel, in my mind, revolve around the nature of our Heavenly Mother. That She exists is clearly church doctrine, but almost nothing else about Her has been revealed. How is She involved in our lives? I have sometimes seen a sunset or a mountain meadow full of flowers and imagined a feminine hand in the design. I am certain that it will not just be masculine arms that enfold us about eternally in their love in a glorious future day. And I am certain that She is a being of perfect love and infinite power, Heavenly Father’s equal partner and subservient to no one. I will not list other questions that I have about Her, or speculate, because I think it would distract from the flow of my thoughts. Suffice it to say that this is an area where I think Heavenly Father might be pleased to have us yearn to know more; He cannot possibly blame us for wanting to be close to the Being that He adores more than any other in the universe.

Women have not been treated as equals of men in most of the world’s cultures, for virtually all of recorded history. This is sad. It hurts the women who suffer, and it deprives the world of much beauty, wisdom, and leadership. I readily admit that billions of lifetimes have included or now include discrimination, disrespect, and unfair oppression based purely on gender. Sometimes that cultural baggage manifests in the church. Any time I hear a story about some boneheaded male insisting that women must obey because they’re bound to “follow the priesthood,” I cringe. Modern church leaders have repeatedly condemned this false idea, and the Lord’s own feelings on the subject are excruciatingly clear in D&amp;C 121. “No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood” doesn’t leave much wiggle room. Women have had no stronger advocate, anywhere in history, than Jesus Christ. And He says that I should be like Him, which (in my mind) makes me a feminist in the best sense. I am thrilled that women gave prayers at general conference, and I welcome any other developments along those lines that might happen.

The <i>real</i> doctrine, it seems to me, is that the Lord expects us all--male and female--to recognize one another’s inherent worth, and to uphold one another in patience and faith. The hand cannot say to the foot, “I have no need of thee.” And we strengthen the feeble knees and lift up the hands that hang down, and mourn with those that mourn, without any regard to gender. A Relief Society president or Primary President is not my direct leader, but I still raise my hand to sustain her, and I am duty bound to show that sustaining by my words and actions and prayers. There is certainly a responsibility for us to listen to the prophet or a stake president or a bishop, but that responsibility applies just as much to men as to women. Wives should sustain their husbands, but there is an <i>equal</i> responsibility for husbands to sustain their wives.

Having admitted that mistreatment and disrespect are a problem, I need to note that I don’t believe patriarchy (at least in the church) is inherently evil. To understand why, let’s do a thought experiment about a naive sort of “give the women the priesthood” scenario. Suppose that women could be ordained deacons at 12, teachers at 14, and so forth. Suppose women could be bishops and patriarchs and stake presidents and temple sealers and apostles and the prophet. In this scenario, biological and social fatherhood without the priesthood is the complement and emotional analog for men to biological and social motherhood for women, and the priesthood is simply an administrative duty that the genders share equally.

What would such a world be like?

For one, every worthy young woman would be expected to serve a mission. That is a priesthood duty.

12-year-old girls would be out knocking on doors to collect fast offerings. Would this be on alternate months to the male deacons, or would you have male and female companionships taking alternate routes, like in the mission field? Who would be responsible to divvy out the work across gender boundaries, hold deacons accountable, report back?

I am not sure this feels good to me.

Could a man be the Primary President? After all, motherhood has no privileged standing with respect to children in the ward...

Could a man be the Relief Society president?

“Ah,” you say. “Of course we wouldn’t do <i>that</i>. There’d still be separate organizations. Women preside over the women’s organization; men preside over the men’s. The Relief Society would have elders and high priests in it, and so would the men’s organization. The bishop could be called from the ranks of either one.”

I think this violates the notion of quorums in the scriptures in some pretty fundamental ways; we are taught that quorums are composed of those with the same priesthood office, and that the president of that quorum should sit in council with the members and teach them their duties. Quorums are supposed to consist of peers who understand and support one another through shared experiences and challenges. It’s pretty hard to do that if your quorum membership spans genders. I can imagine all kinds of concerns with propriety if we had a male president of female elders, or vice versa.

Which brings up the notion of presidencies. In the episcopal church that allows women priests, the priests function more or less solo. They may have an advisory council, but there is no equivalent to an LDS presidency.

In our church, if women held the priesthood, whether or not quorums crossed gender lines, you’d have some sticky issues with presidency. Counselors would have to be the same gender as the president, because the trio (or pairs from the trio) sits in council, in private, for long hours away from their family. Same for the ward clerk and executive secretary, since they often provide a second adult to allow a bishop to interview without being solo. Integrated presidencies would be out of the question.

The same would be true at the stake level, and in area and mission presidencies, and in the presiding bishopric and the presidents of the 70 and in the First Presidency.

You might get around this awkward gender boundary/propriety issue by creating separate but parallel priesthood offices; perhaps there’s a female office called “ministering sister” that’s the equivalent of an “elder”, able to do the same things, only within a quorum of women. Maybe you’d have a female office called “laurel” that’s got a presidency with duties similar to those of a “priest”...

Hmm, that sounds kind of familiar...

What I conclude from this thought experiment is that there would be enormous logistical problems in church organization if we had the sort of naive arrangement that goes along with the “give women the priesthood” idea. I am not using this as an argument that women priesthood holders are anti-doctrinal, just observing that it would be complicated. If you compare this to the change where all worthy males received the priesthood, I think you’ll agree that the change to ordain women would have much wider organizational and procedural repercussions.

I give it as my opinion that the women’s organizations we already have are a far better way to organize women than the naive and chaotic intermingling in our thought experiment, and that if we ever have a doctrinal revelation about ordaining women, it will likely use organizations that are already in place, such that (maybe, for example) Relief Society becomes a quorum, Laurels becomes a quorum, and so forth. If you agree, then ordaining women wouldn’t just be a policy change; it would involve the unfolding of new doctrine about the meaning of quorums. There would have to be a complement to D&amp;C 107 that enumerates the responsibilities of the “ministering sister” quorum, for example. I could imagine Relief Society presidencies sitting on the stand at church. I can imagine “Sister Elaine Dalton” being called “President Elaine Dalton” in General Conference, or the Relief Society meeting being called a “sixth session” of General Conference just like the current priesthood session.

I’d like to go back to the question of a man being primary president for a minute, to make a different observation. I don’t like the idea of ordaining women <i>in a naive way, without further doctrinal insight</i>, because I think it’s based on a false premise that men and women are virtually interchangeable. I have heard that some LDS feminists say that biological and social and spiritual motherhood are in every way analogous to biological and social and spiritual fatherhood, and that the priesthood is quite an independent question.

I don’t agree.

Biological fatherhood is basically an act of sperm donorship. Biological motherhood is far, far more profound. Not only are two bodies and two emotional constitutions transformed during pregnancy, but there is also the act of nursing and a host of biological changes that continue for months after birth. A woman who has become a mother knows it. A man who has become a father might have no clue.

I don’t think that fatherhood without priesthood is as rich of an experience as motherhood without priesthood. I just don’t. Subtract priesthood from fatherhood, and I think you’re left with an anemic sort of relationship. Sure, it has much potential for service and love, but I don’t think it’s a very good analog for motherhood at all. They are not equally rich experiences.

All of which leads me to conclude that if women were to receive the priesthood, we’d need some doctrinal elaboration on the nature of fatherhood and masculinity as well. Many feminists in the world are actually quite anti-male. I think that is far, far less the case in the church, but I still get occasional glimpses of assumptions that I think are a bit one-sided. In an eagerness to amplify and clarify the role of women (which I think is 100% good, and 100% in harmony with the Lord’s desires), there is sometimes a lack of pondering about the implications for men. I have never--not once in my life--recited something in my Sunday meetings that tells me I am a beloved son of God, that I have a divine nature, that I have individual worth. There is no such litany for men. Certainly we know that we have such a status, doctrinally, but because priesthood is connected with worthiness, there is far less emphasis on intrinsic worth. If a presiding role is not in some sense inherently masculine, and the nurturing role is not inherently masculine, then what is?

Some feminists get restive when they hear LDS women talk about how they’re put on a pedestal because of motherhood. They point out (correctly) that this is a bit hollow for childless women. But I don’t hear them talking about how hollow it might be for men to a) have no emphasis on inherent worth; b) be taught that priesthood doesn’t define them either. In saying this, I am not trying to complain or make debate points; I’m just trying to show that this is a broad doctrinal issue, not just a narrow matter of women’s roles and outdated assumptions about leadership.

Anyway, bottom line for me is that I would welcome additional light. I don’t believe the position of women in the church today is bad. I think women have significant responsibilities and are generally held in high esteem. In a major contrast with the blacks-and-the-priesthood issue, nobody is unable to enjoy temple blessings, serve missions, or have meaningful ministering opportunities because women don’t formally exercise the priesthood. However, I can see some places where traditions might change to good advantage, and I would welcome those changes if they came. I love the women in my life and want them to be happy and independent and 100% my peers and equals, and I am confident that this is the feeling in the Lord’s heart as well. I believe we’ll see the Lord’s vision for His children unfold in such a way that the future will be more glorious than we can imagine, and that despite stretches to our patience today, we will not look upon imperfections in today’s church organization as a major unhappiness when we have the benefit of a longer perspective.]]></content:encoded>

You've had that experience, I suppose: a person stands in the font, nose half-plugged, with water streaming off their face, going down and coming up, while they hear names of people they've never known.</div><div> </div><div>As I did the <span class="il">baptisms</span> with my daughters, the thought that was running through my mind was: "I hope these girls have a good experience. I hope they don't think this is boring and pointless."</div><div> </div><div>That got me thinking: why, exactly, is it so important that we do this stuff? Couldn't the Lord have just made it so people who died and wanted to accept the gospel could just... accept it, without so much fuss? Or couldn't he have just made it so that we could do one <span class="il">baptism</span> for a thousand or a million or a billion names at a time?</div><div> </div><div>After I thought this, I had an idea come to my mind that changed my perspective a lot. It was this: God is a personal, individual god, not an aggregate god, and His plan is a personal one. He doesn't see His children as a crowd; he sees each of us, one at a time. Moses got a glimpse of God's perspective; he beheld the inhabitants of the earth, and "there was not a soul which he beheld not." Notice the individuality of it. But when Moses got fixated on the vastness of creation, God emphasized something different: "innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">I know them</span>." </div><div> </div><div>In other words, God isn't interested in saving *all* of us, so much as He longs to save every last *one* of us, personally. The Savior who stood for hours while the Nephites came to feel his wounds, one by one, could never exemplify a Father's love that was just general, cosmic benevolence. Waving his hands with a broad pronouncement to save us all doesn't cut it, because that's not the kind of Father we have. It would be like a dad throwing one birthday party for all his children, and not letting each kid have their own special day. We have the kind of Heavenly Father who wants each of us to spend some personal, 1:1 time with him every day in prayer, and who makes Himself available for that without restriction. He has plenty of other stuff to do, but *that* is his priority. Heavenly Father's plan was one where every last one of His children gets their own, individual experience with salvation. Each one of us gets to go into the water, on our own. We are in the habit of saying that there is one baptismal prayer, as recorded in the Doctrine &amp; Covenants--but in fact, that is wrong. There is a unique baptismal prayer for every single, last child of Heavenly Father. We each get our own, with our own unique name in it.</div><div> </div><div>This is why Heavenly Father's first word to Joseph Smith was "Joseph," not "This is my Beloved Son." This is why Jesus' first word at the garden tomb was "Mary," not "I have risen." Our names are, each, sacred to Him, because we are, each, sacred to Him.</div><div> </div><div>This is why we do <span class="il">baptisms</span> for the dead--because nothing else is good enough for God's children. Every child gets their own spiritual birthday party. One at a time. As long as it takes. That God would allocate a thousand years of earth's history to make sure it happens, and that He would rather have us get waterlogged and tired than speed up the process or skip somebody, tells us something. God's offer of an individual encounter with each of His children is totally non-negotiable.</div><div> </div><div>Now, back to the general question of "saving ordinances". What are they, really? They are not arbitrary requirements to be checked off, imposed by a demanding and impersonal deity. They are offers to have a personal encounter with God, where God doesn't just leave us with a warm feeling about what happened. Instead, God wants to go on record, with witnesses, that He loves this child whose name is part of the ordinance. God wants His promise to be written down, so that His child knows He means it. God wants to celebrate it. God wants it to be special. And He wants us to make it special, too.</div><div> </div><div>You don't have to be famous to have a saving ordinance. You don't have to be educated, or beautiful, or talented. You don't have to grow up in a first-world country. You don't have to be perfect.</div><div> </div><div>You just have to show up for your birthday party, of your own volition.</div><div> </div><div>Some of God's most wonderful children haven't had any or all of their saving ordinances, because they don't understand them. Does this mean they are bad people? No. Does it mean they are going to hell? No. Does it mean that the story isn't over? Yes.</div><div> </div><div>When all is said and done, each of God's children will understand that their Father is inviting them in to the feast, offering to covenant with them. When they understand that, then--and only then--will a rejection of the ordinances be a true failure or rejection of Him.</div><div> </div><div>Some of God's children want to flip this on its head. "How dare you ask us to show up for a birthday party!" they say. "Don't you love us regardless of whether we feel like attending?"</div><div> </div><div>Of course He loves his children who don't show up. If it's a matter of time, or expense, or inconvenience, He will spare no effort to make things work. He sends valiant sons and daughters to every corner of the world--to the Atacama desert, to Tokyo, to Siberia, to Nairobi and Mumbai and Hyden, Kentucky--to deliver invitations to the birthday party; and when one servant has to leave, he sends another servant, and another, and another, and another. He will--he has--quite literally move[d] heaven and earth.</div><div> </div><div>In the end, some of his children may still choose not to come. God will still set the table. He will have a beautiful cake. He will have other guests ready on a moment's notice to greet the guest of honor. And in the center of the table, in an envelope, there will be His present to that child: "Here's everything I have to give--absolutely everything your heart could possibly desire--a whole universe of it. All for you."</div><div> </div><div>Someone might say, "But what if I'm not the sort of person who likes birthday parties? I'd rather love God in a different way. Don't make me be something I'm not."</div><div> </div><div>That is each child's right; God will not force anyone to come. But I think it's a bit unfair to paint God as the demanding party in this scenario. He gives us life, in all its wonder and variety. He gives us agency. He teaches us moral laws, and He offers to help us be totally happy, if we will just believe that He knows what He's doing and His commandments and plan will work. And then He makes the ultimate sacrifice to enable our unfettered choice. If we walk away in such circumstances, it is like an ungrateful child who complains instead of honoring the tender efforts and sacrifice of the parent who threw them a party at enormous expense.</div><div> </div><div>God lives at the palace, and that's where He's inviting us--begging us--to come; we can't head out into the wilderness and then complain that we we got lousy accommodations because He was inhospitable.</div><div> </div><div>In other words, saving ordinances aren't an unfair imposition. They're proof positive of God's love and inclusiveness.</div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning I was reading <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.18-19?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Doctrine &amp; Covenants 59</a>, and I was struck by verses 18 and 19:
<blockquote>Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart. Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.</blockquote>
What I like about this is that God isn't utilitarian. He doesn't limit His concern to just those things that make life possible; instead, He cares about whether we have perfumed roses, or sunsets drenched in color, or cute puppies, or delicious peaches--just because they gladden the heart. Whether we have a glad heart is something He cares about very deeply.

This is the same idea that's conveyed by one of my favorite Primary songs, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/my-heavenly-father-loves-me?lang=eng" target="_blank">My Heavenly Father Loves Me</a>." The lyrics are beautiful. Here's an excerpt:
<div style="margin-left:2em;margin-bottom:2em;">He gave me my eyes, that I might see
the color of butterfly wings.
He gave me my ears that I might hear
the magical sounds of things.</div>
This resonates for me. I can believe in a God who delights to share beauty--for no other reason than because it's uplifting and soul-satisfying. I am also reminded of a wonderful poem that my mother first shared with me:
<div style="margin-left:2em;">"Pied Beauty", by Gerard Manley Hopkins</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">GLORY be to God for dappled things—</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Landscape plotted and pieced—fold, fallow, and plough;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;"></div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">All things counter, original, spare, strange;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise him.</div>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is the 209th anniversary of the birth of Joseph Smith, who founded the church I belong to.

Joseph has always been a controversial figure. Much has been said about him, both good and bad. Joseph predicted this, and with characteristic forthrightness, he admitted how amazing some of his claims must feel to others: "You don’t know me; you never knew my heart. No man knows my history. I cannot tell it: I shall never undertake it. I don’t blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself." (April 7, 1844; <em>History of the Church</em>, vol 6, about page 312)

I said in <a title="What I Believe" href="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/2014/08/30/what-i-believe/">another post</a> that I knew Joseph's account about a vision was true--and that the book he translated is true as well.

I stand by that.

I also said that I wished Joseph's critics would spend as much time on the abundant evidence of his goodness as they spend trying to impugn him. He was human and flawed, without question--and I don't feel a need to hide from that. I believe in being true, even when it's messy. But one kind of truth that I want to repeat is this undeniable fact: those who knew him well loved the simple goodness that was deeply ingrained in his character, and they judged him to be worth following.

Here is an example. It comes from Lyman O. Littlefield, the son of one of my ancestors, Waldo Littlefield. Lyman, his brother, and his father participated in a difficult experience called Zion's Camp--a thousand-mile march across the American wilderness at Joseph's behest. At the time, Lyman was a young boy, shy of his 14th birthday, and when he arrived for the march, he had never met Joseph before. Here's what he said (as recorded in Juvenile Instructor, 1892):
<blockquote>As I was then so very young I was naturally enough not made acquainted with the intricate or minute order in which the camp was organized for traveling; but I remember that they were classed into messes of tents for purposes of cooking, washing our clothing, eating, sleeping, etc. While there the men were paraded outside of the camp for exercise and instruction. This was an unpleasant feature for me, as I was too young and too small of stature to act with the men. This created within me, as I remember, some lonesome reflections. I sat down upon a rock where the men were passing, the better to observe their movements. While thus seated, the Prophet Joseph Smith, who happened to be passing by in quite a hurry, noticed me. He stepped to where I sat alone.

It might have been my isolated position that attracted him. I knew not the motive; but that man who to me appeared so good and so godlike, really halted in his hurry to notice me, only a little boy. Placing one of his hands upon my head, he said:"Well, bub, is there no place for you?"

This recognition from the man whom I then knew was a Prophet of God created within me a tumult of emotions. I could make him no reply. My young heart was filled with joy to me unspeakable. He passed on and left me in my lonely attitude, for he was then in quite a hurry to accomplish something pertaining to the movements of the men which could not be delayed.

I mention this circumstance as it illustrates a trait of his character, which in after years he has often been seen to exemplify. He was naturally fond of the young, especially little children. He did not like to pass a child, however small, without speaking to it. He has been known to actually cross a street if he saw a child alone on the opposite side, to speak to it or to inquire if it had lost its way.

These little acts of human sympathy were prompted by those innate qualities planted in his heart which rendered it so easy and natural for him to be ever prompt in administering kindness and rendering aid to all who chanced to move within his accustomed rounds of life. He was not only kind and gentle to the youth, but the aged he treated with the respect due their
whitened locks; and their tottering limbs could ever find ready and willing support on his strong arm, ever prompt to lead them to the place where inclination or duty called for their presence.

The proud men of the earth may not bend their stubborn dignity to such simple acts of kindness; the monarch may not deign to grant a nod of recognition to the courtiers at the precincts of his throne; the blood- stained conqueror may not award any token of gratitude to the warrior who won his battles; the wily usurper may turn coldly from the men who made his schemes for advancement a success; men with adamantine hearts may exist in the higher walks of life, even where civilization boasts of refinement, and humanity is boastful.

These things have been placed upon the records of the world, in history of ambitious, sordid and selfish man; but such traits of character formed no portion of the election of the man who, from kindly prompting, touched with his open palm my youthful head at the highway side when the bustling scenes of Zion's Camp were in progress.

Thus I have made allusion to my first introduction to an acquaintance with Joseph Smith, the God-chosen Prophet of the nineteenth century. In my estimation he was good and great, and even one of God's noblemen. My subsequent acquaintance with him proved to me that my first estimate of his true character was not too highly formed.</blockquote>
I used to be an insecure teenager, myself--plus I am currently an assistant scoutmaster, and I have four boys of my own. I think I know something about the heart of scrawny, anxious 13- and 14-year-olds. And I think I could like a man who stops and talk to them, just to be nice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight:400;">In my discipline of software architecture, one buzzword that invites occasional discussion is </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">system thinking</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. This is the notion that certain things can only be understood as a whole or gestalt, not as independent pieces. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</span>

[caption id="attachment_115" align="alignnone" width="2412"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115" src="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/system.jpg" alt="system" width="2412" height="1300" /> <span style="color:#808080;"><em>(partial map of the internet, from The Opte Project, Wikimedia Commons; http://bit.ly/2PrfOte)</em></span>[/caption]

<span style="font-weight:400;">I see this constantly in software. Building something complex like the Facebook ecosystem is more than just building the pieces. It involves the mustering of technical, legal, business, and cultural forces in multiple dimensions, across large spans of time. There's incredible interplay and feedback loops. I've </span><a href="https://codecraft.co/2013/02/05/smart-geeks-think-like-cheerleaders/"><span style="font-weight:400;">blogged about this</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="https://codecraft.co/2012/10/23/on-seps-squirrels-and-meta-questions/"><span style="font-weight:400;">more than once</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">But of course this is not just a computer thing. Analysis (breaking things down) and synthesis (understanding things together) is a civilization-wide dialectic between western and eastern paradigms. And system thinking--or the lack thereof--is relevant everywhere. In politics, granular decisions about X and Y get debated on their individual merits, but the cumulative cultural momentum of hundreds of political choices and thousands of situations are rarely understood or discussed to my satisfaction, because we want sound bites. The unit of decision-making is an individual law or executive order or press conference or treaty. In arguments between teenagers and spouses, I see one side focusing like a laser on a small injustice, but not wanting to acknowledge the tapestry of interactions in which they were a full participant and against which the particular offense stands out. In health care, we diagnose discrete problems and prescribe discrete solutions with limited success. What if the real solution to a diabetes epidemic involves variables like diet and exercise, or (moving to progressively higher-order systems) screen time as a hobby in America, or patterns of work/life balance in Western culture, or correcting flaws in the economic model of capitalism, or all of the above, all at once?</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Several years ago, I was listening to a performance of a hymn ("Amazing Grace", IIRC). The words felt poignant, and I had a revelatory moment where I understood how their message applied directly and personally to me. I felt a burst of gratitude, and I said a spontaneous, silent prayer of thanks that I'd been placed in a situation where I would hear that performance.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">In response to that prayer of thanks, a thought came into my mind then that has altered my perspective ever since. I heard unspoken words more or less like these: "You're welcome. I have been working on this moment for you for a long time. I gave talents to people who were born 200 years ago. I inspired the musician who selected the chords. I helped Western culture invent the diatonic scale upon which this music is based. I inspired the woman who put it in a hymnbook and the mother who convinced this pianist to practice as a child. I helped the vocalist fall in love with this hymn and want to perform it. I helped the lyricist on his personal journey from oppressor to penitent, and then nudged him to put pen to paper. I am happy that you can see the fruition of my love for you."</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">In other words, blessing me through the music was not best understood as the result of a single discrete action taken by God on that particular day. It was just one manifestation of an entire system of behavior that stretched back through eternity. My awareness and imagination of it barely scratched the surface. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">There was an unspoken corollary: although I was seeing the musical performance through the lens of how it affected me, all of these blessing actions were part of a multidimensional system that also aimed to bless an infinite number of others. And my joy and my learning moment that day were themselves part of the same system of goodness. They would ripple outward for divine ends I couldn't know.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Remember Elder Bednar's talk about brush strokes on a canvas producing a glorious painting--but only when viewed as a totality instead of as discrete items?</span>

<a href="https://youtu.be/VZljNTyemcU?t=651"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118" src="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/screen-shot-2018-12-07-at-4-02-11-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-12-07 at 4.02.11 PM.png" width="2344" height="1228" /></a>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Scriptural descriptions of God include "the same from all eternity to all eternity", "eternal and unchanging", "the beginning and the end", and "the great I AM." He says "all things are present before me." I believe one meaning of such statements is that God relates to The System differently than we do. It is all comprehended as one great and beautiful whole for Him, and He is in and through all of it.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">We are such limited creatures. We experience time sequentially, and the people we are tomorrow are different from the people we were yesterday. Even if our </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">natures</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> didn't change at all from day to day, the thoughts we could think in relation to unfolding events would differ from one moment to the next. But if God is truly the same at all points in time, I imagine it might mean that he is thinking and experiencing all of His thoughts with respect to all events--the whole System--simultaneously and forever. This morning when He listened to my prayers, he was also talking to Moses on Mt. Sinai, and weeping with Enoch, and inspiring Mother Teresa to found a hospital in Calcutta, and chastening me for the selfish choices I made as a teenager. All of it is there together, all at once--just as all of the events leading up to my moment of joy with a hymn, and everything connected to it up and down, forward and backward, left and right, are all there, too.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">A Jewish teen needs comfort and instruction in 600 BC in Jerusalem. A 14-year-old boy seeks help in 1820. A modern missionary needs to learn to compliment her companion more. An Iranian mother in the 1960s needs to teach her daughter Isabel a principle about loving truth. And Isabel, today, needs to remember that principle so she'll be receptive to the door approach of the missionary companion who needs a confidence boost. If all this potential comes together right, three years from now Isabel can take her deceased mother's name to the temple and unlock experiences for her on the other side of the veil.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Seeing this, God (the ultimate "thing to act rather than be acted upon") breathes gently into The System at all of these points, all at once. It is not so much discrete actions, as it is a sunshine of goodness that lights up everything it touches. Nephi's experience and the restoration of the gospel and the temple work for the Iranian mother are one and the same divine orchestration, and time/sequencing is a limited, human artificiality that doesn't constrain God at all.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">So, finally, let me bend back to the topic of evolution. I believe in intelligent design--but not the sort that's usually imagined. I don't think God just showed up a few times along the way to steer life, or that he set clockworks in motion and sat back to watch it all unfold. Both of those formulations feel like silly trivializations to me. Rather, I think God's nature as a loving, intelligent, and powerful being pulls Him irresistibly into participation with the System. How could He stand to withhold His sunshine from even one corner of the universe, for even a moment?</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I don't know if modern science has all the particulars of evolution right. Most parts of it feel pretty correct to me, and a few parts are still under </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleonomy"><span style="font-weight:400;">intense debate in academic circles</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. But I would be astonished if the economy of heaven ordained a physical world that operated according to beautiful and profound laws, and then took arbitrary shortcuts through the System. It would be like Rembrandt pulling out a canvas and getting his paints set up, and then slapping a newsprint photo of his subject on the canvas so he didn't have to waste so much time painting the face.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114" src="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/rembrandt.jpg" alt="rembrandt" width="2114" height="1168" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">God is more patient, more loving, more involved, and more of a Craftsman than that. We might be tempted to wave a magic wand to create a fish; we think of time as a finite resource and genetic engineering as something done in weeks with million-dollar lab equipment. But God can build a fish the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">right</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> way. And so He does. The recipe says it takes several billion years of cook time? No problem. After all, the Master is not in a hurry, and fishes are vital. They are how he is going to feed 5000, and thence redeem a penitent slave trader, and bless Isabel and her mother. And they are going to feed a little girl in Bangladesh tomorrow. Are not the cell membrane in a tide pool a billion years ago, and the prompting to a missionary companion today, and a trillion trillion other details like unto them, really one continuous, ineffable, incomprehensible act of unutterable love and atonement?</span>

<i><span style="font-weight:400;">Of course</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> we can't point to a smoking gun that proves an Intelligent Designer intervened. That's because He's not a limited interventionist. He's a </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">participant</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, and His touch is so pervasive that it's woven into all of reality. We're like fish who can't see the water. But it is there. The Living Water is there.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight:400;">Recently I have been impressed with the worldview of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrzESek2B2E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimalism</a> or voluntary simplicity movement. This is a lifestyle that advocates stripping away cruft to the point that you retain just what's truly core to your heart and your life purposes. Minimalism's proponents are known for eliminating physical clutter or living in tiny houses, but the streamlining is broader, including how we fill our minds, our time, and our dinner plates.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I see strong resonance between minimalism and other things I value:</span>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The church's recent <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2019/04/35oaks?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasis on simplifying and distilling</a>. Jesus's <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/9.58?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p57" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comment</a> that foxes had holes and birds had nests, but he had almost nothing. The lifestyle I lived as a missionary. Elder Bednar's comments about <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2018/10/gather-together-in-one-all-things-in-christ?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unifying everything into a singular focus on Christ</a>.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Several business books that advocate a rejection of multitasking, and a "<a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin with the end in mind</a>" or "<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start with why</a>" focus that is singular and razor sharp.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The sort of lifestyle practiced by Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and others who gave great service without distraction.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The ethos of being kind to the earth and its creatures. Avoiding <a href="https://youtu.be/9GorqroigqM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hollow consumerism, waste, and pollution</a>. Living off the grid. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHJiNC_7wuw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eating local and vegetarian</a>. Being self-sufficient.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight:400;">I talked this over with Linda. I have decided that I am going to make serious efforts to minimize. I believe Linda feels aligned and eager to do the same, though she will of course approach it in her own way. (Minimalists say that everybody's definition of what is core will be different, which suggests to me that as we jettison layers of irrelevance, the individual talents and interests that make us unique shine brighter. This is going to be a fun adventure of self discovery for us.)</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">When people go on a diet or quit smoking, they tell as many people as possible about the change, so they can get support and feel accountable to others. So I'm sending you this note to announce my intentions and ask that of you.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">One way you can help me is to accept a new mindset I am adopting toward gifts, keepsakes, and hand-me-downs. The mindset could be summarized as: on giving occasions, what I will value most will be a phone call, a letter, a hug, a memory, a photo, a poem, or a shared experience with you, and not so much something tangible or monetary. Since I will be trying not to have extra pairs of socks and ties and books around, such things will be harder for me to fit into my minimizing strategy. And I probably won't take you up on most offers of free clothes or furniture. I'm more or less a dieter hoping his friends don't offer him dessert very often. :-)</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I won't be totally rigid about this; I couldn't stand that. A few of the things I own are tangible gifts that are incredibly precious. For example, I own a beautiful afghan that my mom created for me over a period of many months, at great effort. I vividly remember her counting loops on it in evening hours during some dark and cold winter evenings. I sleep with it in the winter, sometimes, and I will never voluntarily part with it. I also own a pair of sandals that I inherited from my father-in-law; they are my favorite pair of shoes and I will wear them until they fall apart. By stripping away the possessions that don't reach this high bar of tenderness for me, I am trying to pay greater honor to what's special about the few that remain.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-124" src="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img_20190511_132904.jpg" alt="IMG_20190511_132904" width="3036" height="3805" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">I hope this doesn't bother you, or strike you as selfish. I won't be prickly or ungrateful if you give me something tangible, and I plan to continue my current gift-giving habits toward you, unless you tell me otherwise. I just feel like I need to try hard to make a sea change in the way I think about possessions.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I would love encouragement and questions as I embark on this experiment.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>I. Snowballs</h2>



<p>Years ago, I threw a snowball at my favorite seminary teacher. It was an act of affection in my 14-year-old mind — I felt playful. She was chatting with family as she opened her car door after church, and I expected her to chuckle at a fluffy thud nearby.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I threw from far away; a lot of kinetic energy was involved. Plus I gave no warning, I packed the snow too much, and I was more accurate than I intended. My teacher's recoil, and her expression as she wiped the spray of ice from her face, still fill me with dismay.</p>


<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":139,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"media"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/istock-525139781.jpg"><img src="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/istock-525139781.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-139" /></a><figcaption>(Not my teacher -- but a good approximation of the event.)</figcaption></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->


<p>I startled and hurt this kind woman who'd been my friend. I gave her a scare about scratches to her eye, and I caused her some pain. Despite innocent intentions, I conveyed disrespect and earned her disappointment.</p>



<p>My teacher didn't hide her discomfort, but neither did she remonstrate. I apologized. She waved a reassurance. Then she got in her car and meekly drove away. She never brought it up with me again, and I believe she forgave me.</p>



<h2>II. Siblings</h2>



<p>My family talks about politics from time to time. One Sunday evening we got on the subject, and my brother articulated some ideas that I considered wrong-headed. I told him so — and I wasn't very gentle about it. Several others chimed in, adding a variety of perspectives. Words flew back and forth. I wouldn't say the spirit in the room was ugly, but it got a bit impatient and tense.</p>



<p>My sister interrupted us with a heartfelt lecture on why family unity was more important than winning a political debate. She spoke for a long time, and she was so impassioned that I began to feel a bit hurt. I hadn't thought I was <em>that</em> over-the-top. But I also saw the wisdom in what she was saying. Apparently I'd thrown another snowball. So much for teenage lessons learned...</p>



<p>I swallowed my pride and agreed to end that particular discussion — and to never have another one like it. I have tried sincerely. I've had some successes and some failures. Particularly in the last year or two, I've struggled to be a witness of truths that feel important to me, without becoming contentious.</p>



<h2>III. Saints</h2>



<p>On June 5, 1834, a group known as Zion's Camp crossed the Mississippi River into Missouri. They had come to redress wrongs that members of the church — "saints" — were suffering at the hands of local settlers. Joseph Smith was their leader.</p>



<p>The journey to Missouri had been physically and emotionally demanding. Members of the camp did not always get along. Tempers frayed. Sickness had been a problem. George A. Smith, the prophet's young cousin, recalled, "most of the men in the Camp complained to him of sore toes, blistered feet, long drives, scanty supply of provisions, poor quality of bread, bad corn dodger, frowsy butter, strong honey, maggoty bacon and cheese." [George A. Smith, “My Journal,” Instructor, May 1946, 217] On top of this, Missourians were hostile enough that there were concerns for personal safety — so much so that Samuel Baker, the oldest member of the camp, gifted Joseph a huge mastiff guard dog named Major. [Alexander Baugh, "Joseph Smith’s Dog, Old Major", BYU Studies Quarterly 56:4. <a href="https://j.mp/34TlXJi">https://j.mp/34TlXJi</a>.]</p>

<p>Joseph apparently loved this dog. They bonded on the trek. His children developed fond memories of the animal. "Old Major" even stayed with him later, during Joseph's bleak winter months at Liberty Jail. [Ibid]</p>



<p>But not everyone in the company appreciated Major during that June expedition. Sylvester Smith (no relation to Joseph) became annoyed when the dog had to be kept from attacking men who marched into camp under Sylvester's direction. Apparently his feelings were strong enough that he insulted Joseph at length, and threatened to kill the dog. The next night as the camp tried to sleep, Major barked a lot, enraging Sylvester further. He repeated his threat against the dog. This angered Joseph, who told Sylvester, "If you kill that dog I will whip you." [George A. Smith, <em>Memoirs of George A. Smith</em>, 29] Feelings between the two men remained raw for months afterward. [See Godfrey and others, <em>Documents</em>, Volume 4, 125, 129–30, The Joseph Smith Papers. <a href="http://j.mp/353UCo4">http://j.mp/353UCo4</a>.]</p>



<h2>IV. Meditations</h2>



<p>One thread running through each of these stories is the idea that people sometimes behave in hurtful ways. We all get hit by a snowball, now and then. We all have to put up with a clueless brother, or a person who hates our dog, or a dog whose owner isn't sympathetic enough to our feelings.</p>



<p>Another thread is the sobering realization that sometimes, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">we</span> are those flawed people. All of us have lobbed a metaphorical snowball that did unintended damage. All of us have been stung by our own experience with the early Christian lament, "the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil" (James 3:8). And all of us have become annoyed at circumstances that ruined a night's sleep — or at someone who unfairly held us responsible for such circumstances.</p>



<p>These are important lessons, but perhaps they are the beginning of the learning, rather than the end. I think they should lead us to prize more highly the grace, granted and received, that must be poured into stories like these to give them tolerable endings.</p>



<p>If our family relationships are predominantly happy, grace like this tends to play a big role. Yes, we can remember the time we fought with a brother over clothes he "borrowed", or the unkind judgment passed by a grandparent. But we tend to view the relationship as <em>bigger</em> — more valuable, more multidimensional, more fraught with potential and moral implications — than a few bad memories, or even than a lot of them. Our family members, with all their shortcomings, are also our most intimate friends and allies, and even when we look into their souls and see things we don't love, we can't bear to let that be all that we see. So we seek out, acknowledge, and prize the goodness, too. We look for ways to give one another the benefit of the doubt. We forgive. We make room for the relationship to continue, and to improve. And we hope our loved ones feel the same. Often — perhaps more often than we deserve — they do. Maybe this miracle is among the things Tolstoy intended when he said that all happy families are alike.</p>



<p>The miracle of grace doesn't happen without effort, of course. And some situations are so painful that we can't find grace for a long time, or maybe we can't find it at all. Thomas S. Monson shared a story from the Associated Press about two brothers who quarreled when they were young men. They drew a chalk line down the middle of their shared cabin, and refused to cross it or even speak to one another for the next 62 years, until one of the brothers died. ["School Thy Feelings, O My Brother", Oct 2009. <a href="http://j.mp/3rQkXzD">http://j.mp/3rQkXzD</a>]</p>



<p>But when we hear stories like this, or when we live them, we feel deep sadness. We long for a different ending. This is why my heart swells with admiration and wonder when I think about Mary, who as an elderly woman described for me her childhood experiences with a neglectful, alcoholic stepfather. In a few simple sentences, she recounted her family's poverty from this man spending all his income on booze, and spoke of her mother's wrenching decision to divorce. Then she said something like, "But he wasn't a bad man, in many ways. Things were just hard back then. If we hadn't moved to Vegas, I never would have met my husband." And that was as much as she wanted to say about him.</p>



<p>Oh, Mary! What grace!</p>



<h2>V. Those Other Brothers and Sisters</h2>



<p>We often acknowledge that granting and seeking grace in our families is a divine charge. But are we as mindful of others that Jesus also wants us to treat like our brothers and sisters? Elder Neal A. Maxwell worried that we may be approaching our relationships with fellow believers, and with the thoroughly human officers that lead us in religious contexts, with very different standards:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>There are so many just waiting to be offended. They are so alerted to the possibility that they will not be treated fairly, they almost invite the verification of their expectation! The meek, not on such a fatiguing alert, find rest from this form of fatigue.</p><p>Bruising as the tumble off the peak of pride is, it may be necessary at times. Few of us escape at least some of these bruises. Even then, one must next be careful not to continue his descent into the swamp of self-pity. Meekness enables us, after such a tumble, to pick ourselves up—but without putting others down blamefully. Meekness mercifully lets us retain the realistic and rightful impressions of how blessed we are, so far as the fundamental things of eternity are concerned. We are not then as easily offended by the disappointments of the day, of which there seems to be a sufficient and steady supply.</p><p>When we are thus spiritually settled, we will likewise be less apt to murmur and complain. Indeed, one of the great risks of murmuring is that we can get too good at it, too clever. We can even acquire too large an audience. Furthermore, what for the murmurer may only be transitory grumbles may become a cause for a hearer that may carry him or her clear out of the Church.
</p><cite>"Meek and Lowly", speech at BYU, Oct 1986. <a href="http://j.mp/37XmVGi">http://j.mp/37XmVGi</a></cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>Perhaps we're tolerant of foibles in our peers, but we draw the line at leaders, who we feel have a special duty to earn the "saint" moniker they're supposed to exemplify: "This is the bishop (or the relief society president, or the prophet) we're talking about! How could the church be true (or a divine instrument) if he betrayed a confidence, or she refused to spend church funds to help in our hour of need, or he dissembled, or she said something that was prejudiced?"</p>



<p>Elder Maxwell continues:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>...Since life in the Church illustrates, painfully at times, our own defects, as well as the defects of others, we are bound to be periodically disappointed thereby in ourselves and in others. We cannot expect it to be otherwise in a kingdom where, initially, not only does the net gather “of every kind,” but those of “every kind” are also at every stage of spiritual development (see Matthew 13:47). When people “leave their nets straightway” (see Matthew 4:20 and Mark 1:18), they come as they are—though in the initial process of changing, their luggage reflects their past. Hence, discipleship is a developmental journey that requires shared patience, understanding, and meekness on the part of all who join the caravan...</p><p>...The disciple’s course involves more lab and fieldwork than lectures.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>It's interesting to me that in articulating this principle, Elder Maxwell references Peter leaving his nets. Peter, as we all know, had a lionlike devotion to the Lord. He made extraordinary sacrifices. Aside from the Lord himself, he is the only person that scriptures describe walking on water. In the Savior's name and with faith like a rock, he healed a man lame from his mother's womb — and boldly testified before the Sanhedrin when called to account for it. Tradition has it that he asked to be crucified upside down to discourage comparisons between his own martyrdom and the one of the Master he loved. Popes point to him as their predecessor and exemplar, and operate out of a basilica erected in his honor.</p>



<p>Peter was also the man who urged the Lord to walk away because Peter felt too sinful to remain in His presence. He forgot the Lord's gentle teachings on tolerance and cut off the ear of an attacker. He wept bitterly because he had denied the Lord three times. After witnessing the miracle of the resurrection, he went fishing instead of going out to share the gospel. And even after a remarkable vision, he was reluctant to abandon the prejudices of Judaism and welcome gentiles without precondition; Paul had to rebuke him before his actions matched his words.</p>



<p>It's the same Peter.</p>



<p>So, pelted with metaphorical snowballs, were Peter's contemporaries justified in complaining loudly, or in quitting the church Jesus left in Peter's hands? How might recitations of Peter's offenses play before a Judge who once refused to condemn a woman taken in adultery, whose only public response to Peter's three-fold denial was to look at him, and who patiently prepared a meal for Peter before urging him to do a better job of feeding the sheep? Would not Peter's accusers also be defendants before that same Judge, in that same court of justice — their only defense the infinite price the Judge had personally paid to show them mercy?</p>



<p>We may find Peter an unchallenging test of our forgiveness here; none of us were personally wounded by him, his life had a clear upward trend, we don't have any writings of his critics, and the gulf in culture and time between us and him lets us forgive without a lot of angst. He can be a "saint." But if we ask the same question about Joseph Smith, do we give the same answer?</p>



<p>We may know the Savior's command to forgive all men in D&amp;C 64, but forget the context around it. It was <em>this exact question</em> — whether Joseph as a flawed, human prophet had any claim on our forgiveness — that elicited the Lord's strong words:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>There are those who have sought occasion against him [Joseph] without cause; Nevertheless, he has sinned; but verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, forgive sins unto those who confess their sins before me and ask forgiveness, who have not sinned unto death. My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion against one another and forgave not one another in their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted and sorely chastened. Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin. I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>It seems to me that regardless of encumbering details, the worry some believers feel about Joseph's character could be laid to rest by simply allowing the Lord to have the last word on the subject. He has addressed the indictment. Will we accept His judgment, or not?</p>



<p>Sometimes we may resemble a man in C.S. Lewis's <em>The Great Divorce</em>, troubled that the messenger sent to invite him to heaven has a less angelic backstory than he, the invited guest. Confronting this flawed-but-for-grace messenger, Lewis's character complains:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>I’d have thought you and I ought to be the other way round… I gone straight all my life. I don’t say I was a religious man and I don’t say I had no faults, far from it. But I done my best all my life, see? ... I never asked for anything that wasn’t mine by rights.… You may think you can put me down because you’re dressed up like that (which you weren’t when you worked under me) and I’m only a poor man. But I got to have my rights same as you, see?... And what I don’t see is why I should be put below a bloody murderer like you. I’m not asking for anybody’s bleeding charity.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>The formerly sinful messenger responds to this complaint with some profound advice:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>Then do. At once. Ask for the Bleeding Charity.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>But the offended man turns away instead, unwilling to share grace with the bearer of his heavenly invitation. All heaven rests on accepting God's flawed messenger, and the man turns away.</p>



<p>Do we? There is a 100% chance that all messengers God sends to us will be deeply flawed, too...</p>



<p>A bishop once forgot to show up for the funeral of the child of an immigrant family, forcing the family to carry their unburied child's casket from the locked church in a pouring rain, their guests ungreeted and their grief unshared. It was a sad story of hurt — until the family accepted the bishop's apology, made room for grace, and allowed wounds to heal. [Thomas S. Monsoon, "Hidden Wedges", April 2002. <a href="http://j.mp/356wuRC">http://j.mp/356wuRC</a>]</p>



<p>Which story — Lewis's or the bishop's — has an ending the Lord loves?</p>



<p>So: How do we react to the youth leader who's clumsy or unkind or uninspired with our gay child?</p>



<p>What about the ministering sister who blathers heedlessly on about how delighted she is to be a mother, while our own heart is hurting from childlessness?</p>



<p>What about the apostle who teaches celestial marriage to an audience that includes the reluctantly single, LGBTQ+ members, and people wounded by recent divorce?</p>



<p>The Lord's answer to these questions is very clear, and very consistent, and very challenging. Elder Dale G. Renlund summarized it nicely ["Do Justly, Love Mercy, and Walk Humbly with God", Oct. 2020. <a href="http://j.mp/3obzm72">http://j.mp/3obzm72</a>]:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-large"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>Loving mercy means that we do not just love the mercy God extends to us; we delight that God extends the same mercy to others. And we follow His example. 'All are alike unto God,' and we all need spiritual treatment to be helped and healed.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>God knows this is hard. He is patient. He doesn't expect perfection right away. But he does expect us to acknowledge the standard, and to strive for it.</p>



<p>That means that if we find out our Young Women's president was having an affair, we put down our stones; we don't quit in disgust, and we don't publicize a private sorrow. If a leader chides us unjustly, we take the opportunity to practice meekness, swallow the offense, and press forward. If a self-righteous "saint" makes it harder for us to feel accepted, we accept them regardless. Instead of seeing these flawed others as foreigners or pretenders, we see them as our peers, and we do our best to love them like the Man who promised beauty for ashes and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. We see our relationship with covenant brothers and sisters as <em>bigger</em> — more valuable, more multidimensional, more fraught with potential and moral implications — than a few bad memories, or even than a lot of them. We remember what President Uchtdorf taught:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Remember, heaven is filled with those who have this in common: They are forgiven. And they forgive. Lay your burden at the Savior’s feet. Let go of judgment. Allow Christ’s Atonement to change and heal your heart. Love one another. Forgive one another. The merciful will obtain mercy.</p><cite>"The Merciful Obtain Mercy", April 2012. <a href="http://j.mp/2Lf2rQK">http://j.mp/2Lf2rQK</a></cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>And when we do this, the Lord gives us grace in "good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over" (Luke 6:38). This was the experience of concentration camp survivor Corrie ten Boom, who fought and won a silent battle of the soul to share grace:</p>


<!-- wp:quote {"className":"is-style-default"} -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>It was 1947 and I had come from Holland to defeated Germany with the message that God forgives… ‘When we confess our sins,’ I said, ‘God casts them into the deepest ocean, gone forever. …’</p><p>And that’s when I saw him, working his way forward against the others. One moment I saw the overcoat and the brown hat; the next, a blue uniform and a visored cap with its skull and crossbones. It came back with a rush: the huge room with its harsh overhead lights; the pathetic pile of dresses and shoes in the center of the floor; the shame of walking naked past this man. I could see my sister’s frail form ahead of me, ribs sharp beneath the parchment skin. Betsie, how thin you were!</p><p>Now he was in front of me, hand thrust out: ‘A fine message, Fräulein! How good it is to know that, as you say, all our sins are at the bottom of the sea!’</p><p>And I, who had spoken so glibly of forgiveness, fumbled in my pocketbook rather than take that hand. He would not remember me, of course—how could he remember one prisoner among those thousands of women?...</p><p>‘You mentioned Ravensbruck in your talk,’ he was saying, ‘I was a guard there.’ No, he did not remember me.</p><p>‘But since that time,’ he went on, ‘I have become a Christian. I know that God has forgiven me for the cruel things I did there, but I would like to hear it from your lips as well. Fräulein,’ again the hand came out—’will you forgive me?’</p><p>And I stood there—I whose sins had again and again to be forgiven—and could not forgive. Betsie had died in that place—could he erase her slow terrible death simply for the asking?</p><p>It could not have been many seconds that he stood there—hand held out—but to me it seemed hours as I wrestled with the most difficult thing I had ever had to do.</p><p>For I had to do it—I knew that. The message that God forgives has a prior condition: that we forgive those who have injured us. ‘If you do not forgive men their trespasses,’ Jesus says, ‘neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses.’</p><p>I knew it not only as a commandment of God, but as a daily experience. Since the end of the war I had had a home in Holland for victims of Nazi brutality. Those who were able to forgive their former enemies were able also to return to the outside world and rebuild their lives, no matter what the physical scars. Those who nursed their bitterness remained invalids. It was as simple and as horrible as that.</p><p>And still I stood there with the coldness clutching my heart. But forgiveness is not an emotion—I knew that too. Forgiveness is an act of the will, and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart. ‘… Help!’ I prayed silently. ‘I can lift my hand. I can do that much. You supply the feeling.’</p><p>And so woodenly, mechanically, I thrust my hand into the one stretched out to me. And as I did, an incredible thing took place. The current started in my shoulder, raced down my arm, sprang into our joined hands. And then this healing warmth seemed to flood my whole being, bringing tears to my eyes.</p><p>‘I forgive you, brother!’ I cried. ‘With all my heart!’</p><p>For a long moment we grasped each other’s hands, the former guard and the former prisoner. I had never known God’s love so intensely as I did then. </p><cite>from <em>The Hiding Place</em>; also reprinted in <em>Guideposts</em> magazine in 1972</cite></blockquote>

<p>This year the curriculum for our collective scripture study will be <em>The Doctrine and Covenants</em>. I love this book. It is full of inspired truths and heavenly invitations. And more than any of our other scriptures, we know a lot about the flawed human context that surrounds it. That makes it more precious, more hopeful, more relevant to us — not less.</p>



<p>In its pages we meet a God who patiently reveals things to people who ask clumsy questions, and who are often less than fully worthy of His help. His audience includes the prideful, the impatient, the lazy, the ambitious, the prejudiced, and those who want revenge on their enemies. This is not a God who countenances sin; He commands repentances and warns of the consequences if He is ignored. But He is also merciful beyond our capacity to understand, and He is willing to work with people like Joseph and Brigham and Sidney — and like my ancestors who probably wrestled with their own attitudes toward Joseph's barking dog on Zion's camp. He is the same God who helped Mary wish her stepfather well, and who brought peace to a grieving family wronged by their forgetful bishop, and who overwhelmed Corrie ten Boom with grace.</p>



<p>And because of Him, there's hope for a foolish thrower-of-snowballs like me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once observed:<br></p>


<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Of the many magnificent purposes served in the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, one... aspect... often goes uncelebrated. His followers did not understand it fully at the time, and many in modern Christianity do not grasp it now, but the Savior Himself spoke of it repeatedly and emphatically. It is the grand truth that in all that Jesus came to say and do, including and especially in His atoning suffering and sacrifice, He was showing us who and what God our Eternal Father is like, how completely devoted He is to His children in every age and nation. In word and in deed Jesus was trying to reveal and make personal to us the true nature of His Father, our Father in Heaven."</p><cite>"<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2003/10/the-grandeur-of-god?lang=eng">The Grandeur of God</a>", Oct 2003</cite></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->


<p>Thus, Jesus expects us to take Him seriously when He says, "true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4.23?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p21">John 4:23</a>), and when He prays to the Father: "This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17.3?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p1">John 17:3</a>) And He hopes we will <em>long</em> for the blessing that He promised when He said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.23?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p22">John 14:23</a>)</p>



<p>It is not a coincidence that our <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.1?lang=eng">Articles of Faith begin</a> with, "We believe in God the Eternal Father." It is not a coincidence that the greatest of all dispensations — the time in which "those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.18?lang=eng#p17">D&amp;C 128:18</a>) — began with a personal encounter between a Father and a child that He called by name — and that our 3-year-old Sunbeams now sing "I am a child of God." It is not a coincidence that <a href="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/ordinances-are-evidence-of-gods-love/">after hearing our own names</a> in sacred ordinances, the approving seal of divinity that's invoked always references our Father first. It is not a coincidence that the Lord's prayer, offered as the grand prototype for all of our spiritual yearnings, begins with the words, "Our Father."</p>



<h2>It's personal</h2>



<p>And please note the personal pronoun, because our Great Exemplar repeatedly, emphatically, insisted on viewing the relationship with Father as being intimately personal:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This message — that God is not just a cosmic manifestation of goodness, or a stern immortal demanding our worship, but rather <em>our</em> Father who loves each one of us, individually and personally, and who wants to be bound to us forever — has been repeatedly taught by prophets. Paul reminds us, "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8.15?lang=eng#p14">Rom 8:15</a>). And we have Enoch report the Father's words: "Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency; And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.28,32,33?lang=eng#p31,32">Moses 7:32-33</a>) And we have Brigham Young teaching, "[God] is the Father of our spirits; and if we could know, understand, and do His will, every soul would be prepared to return back into His presence. And when they get there, they would see that they had formerly lived there for ages, that they had previously been acquainted with every nook and corner, with the palaces, walks, and gardens; and they would embrace their Father, and He would embrace them and say, 'My son, my daughter, I have you again;' and the child would say, 'O my Father, my Father, I am here again.'" (<a href="https://scriptures.byu.edu/#:t9c72&amp;palaces:st&amp;1396&amp;1830&amp;2021&amp;j&amp;n&amp;30@0$palaces"><em>Journal of Discourses</em>, Vol. 4, p. 286</a>) And we have President Uchtdorf saying, "Brothers and sisters, the most powerful Being in the universe is the Father of your spirit. He knows you. He loves you with a perfect love. God sees you not only as a mortal being on a small planet who lives for a brief season—He sees you as His child. He sees you as the being you are capable and designed to become. He wants you to know that you matter to Him." ("<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2011/10/you-matter-to-him?lang=eng">You Matter to Him</a>", Oct 2011).</p>



<p>In other words, God will not leave <em>any</em> one of us, His children, fatherless.</p>



<h2>Coming closer to Him</h2>



<p>So, are we living up to our privilege and invitation to know our Father? Do we seek to <em>truly</em>, <em>deeply</em> understand His heart? Is He on our mind? Do we think about how He feels? Do we talk to Him — not just in formulaic prayers, but as a child who needs the listening ear, the counsel, the encouragement, the reassurance of someone who loves us perfectly? Do we long to be closer to Him?&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way we can come to understand our Father better is by observing with spiritual eyes.</p>



<h2>Learning from Jesus's Emulation</h2>



<p>What do we see when we look at Jesus, the Son who was in the express image of His — and our — Father?</p>



<p>Well, we learn that Father is the sort of person who turns water to wine as a kindness to an anxious mother.</p>



<p>Father is the sort of person who foregoes a meal to have a heart-to-heart conversation with a woman at a well — even if that woman isn't having much success keeping the commandments.</p>



<p>Father loves to hold little children.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->


<p>Father weeps with compassion at the grief of Marys and Marthas (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/11.35?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p33">John 11:35</a>).</p>



<p>Father is utterly unimpressed by worldly pomp — but riveted by a daughter reaching out to grasp a robe in a crowd, or a daughter dropping a tiny coin into the temple treasury.</p>



<p>Father feels, intensely, that lonely widows need the consolation of their children. (<em>Jehovah gave commandments about this in the Law of Moses, and taught this principle when He inspired Elijah to raise the son of the widow of Zarephath. And then, to be sure we got the point, as Jesus He personally modelled it twice more for us — first with the widow of Nain, and then with Mary and John, on the cross.</em>)</p>



<p>I believe Jesus even reveals to us some of the personal hygiene habits of our Father, as He neatly folds burial clothes before laying them aside in an empty tomb. (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/20.6-7?lang=eng&amp;clang=eng#p5">John 20:6-7</a>)</p>



<p>"And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written." (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21.25?lang=eng#p25">John 21:25</a>). But since books are limiting and very few of us lived next to Jesus in mortality, Father in his tender outreach to us places other types and shadows in our lives that teach us the same sorts of lessons, in ways suited to our individual circumstances. In many cases, those types and shadows manifest in earthly fathers that we have known and loved, if we have eyes to see. For example:</p>



<h2>Learning from Earthly Fathers</h2>



<p>When I was seven or eight, I vividly remember driving with my dad through early morning fog to an apple orchard that the church owned. There we spent hours clearing away weeds and pruning. I remember my dad's eyes swelling with the pollen, and I remember him sneezing miserably — but staying till the end of the welfare assignment because service and priesthood duty matter. My dad gave me a glimpse of the heart of Father that day.</p>



<p>I remember my dad laughing as he carried me on his shoulders when I was little. That, too, was a revelation about the nature of our Father in Heaven.</p>



<p>My dad has plenty of mortal foibles, but as the years go by, the aspects of his character that hold my attention are the tender and sweet ones. I remember my dad building bunkbeds and climby things for kids. I remember my dad bearing a sincere and loving testimony of Jesus. I remember my dad giving me a blessing when I was sick — and how comforted and safe I felt. I hope many of us can relate to intimate and simple revelations like these.</p>

<p>I want to acknowledge that some of us may find earthly fathers a hard topic. Not all of us have had good experiences with the mortal men who carry that title — and <em>none</em> of us have had perfection. My own assignment as a father has taught me a sober lesson about just how <em>raw</em> the material is that God has to work with when he makes a man into a father. But — praise God! — our Father is the Great Prototype from which Jesus learned to be a fixer of broken things and a plugger of gaps. Sometimes He does that with grandfathers, with fathers-in-law, with fathers of our ward, with President Hinckleys and President Nelsons that He puts in our lives. From men like this, I have learned:</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who delights to slip a Mickey Mouse watch on his daughter's wrist while she sleeps, so the gift is the first thing she sees when she wakes up on her birthday.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who calls his wife "sugar" or "darling" or "sweetheart" every day for sixty years.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who musters courage to march off to fight in World War II to protect his wife and children.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who gets his hands dirty and his shirt sweaty planting and harvesting a garden — and who wants his kids to work alongside him.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who gives up the dream of a career as a dentist, and instead stretches the timetable of his education and shows up year after year at a less interesting job, to provide a stable home.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who buys birdseed for decades to stock feeders in his back yard, and who takes care of old, feeble dogs, shedding tears when they pass away.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the dad who can't endorse his daughter's plan to marry a man who is unworthy of her, and who tells her this awkward truth as gently as he can — but who rejoices years later at her temple wedding to a true helpmeet.</p>



<p>Father is revealed by the grandpa who climbs thirty feet into an oak tree to hang straps for a giant swing so little ones can have a thrilling ride with each visit.</p>



<h2>Learning from Personal Encounters</h2>



<p>Revelations of Father via others are tender mercies. But we are not limited to that type of revelation. Father wants to teach us about Himself in ways that are very direct and private and sacred. After some pondering, I'd like to share one such experience with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Years ago, I was feeling heavily burdened from my own fatherhood. I have worried plenty for each of my children, but on this occasion, Caleb was the one rending my heart. He was in residential treatment far away from our home. I knew he was discouraged. I prayed for inspiration.</p>



<p>My son happened to be a fan of souped up hot rods, and a feeling that came to me through my prayers was that I ought to buy my son a hot rod of his own — something that he could be proud of, and that he could look forward to driving and sharing with his friends when he was home again. I felt that it would give him hope, and that perhaps we could work together to make it fancier.</p>



<p>Still, even though we could cover the costs without debt and I had Linda's approval, I felt a bit conflicted. The car I bought was old enough that the expense wasn't astronomical — but it was significant. I had so many other things to spend money on. My son might have to wait years to drive this car — or might never get to drive it at all. Was I wasting financial resources that the Lord had given us?</p>



<p>As I drove away from the car dealership, all of these doubts, plus worries for my son's welfare, weighed on me. And then I felt Father speak. He simply said, "<em>I</em> would do this." And I knew that He understood everything that was in my heart. He knew that the need for hope and happiness for my son was profoundly important — that I was not just throwing money away, but making a gesture that embodied all the kindness and hope and sunshine a father longed to bring into his son's life. He approved. Kids mattered; money didn't.</p>



<p>Well, that car proved to be a highlight of my son's life. He <em>was</em> thrilled with the gift, and he <em>did</em> talk about it often while he was in residential treatment. He drew pictures. He made plans.</p>



<p>But the Mustang also gathered dust in our driveway for years. And when our son completed his residential treatment, he wasn't able to get a driver's license right away, so it sat some more. And soon after we fired it up and drove around town for the first time, its engine threw a rod, and it died.</p>



<p>Now Father's simple affirmation, "<em>I</em> would do it," took on new meaning for me. He had whispered that to me, even knowing the end from the beginning. He still approved of the exchange of some money for the happiness and hope of the gift.</p>



<p>Years after this event, our car-loving son took his own life, a victim to the demons of mental illness that he had fought for so long. It was a tragic event for our entire family, and one that I am still grieving over. He is as precious to me as each of my other children, and sometimes I have wondered how any of us could go on without him.</p>



<p>After the graveside service, some of Caleb's friends got in a hot rod and peeled out along the road by the cemetery, and Linda and I smiled at each other through our tears. And sometimes, in the days since, we have seen a fancy car pull up next to us in a parking lot or in traffic, and we have said to each other, "Caleb is saying hello to us."</p>



<p>Earlier this week, I was up in the middle of the night with insomnia. I felt an impression to go through an untidy bundle of papers on the shelf. (We've been in the process of our move to Switzerland for months now, and I am completely sick and tired of sorting through boxes and papers. Easier to just toss the whole pile and be done with it. But since Father had prompted me, I got out the bundle and began sorting. Two o'clock in the morning. Ugh!)</p>



<p>Well, in the middle of those papers I found an unmarked envelope. I opened it and found a short, undated letter in Caleb's familiar handwriting. It said:</p>

<p>I am certain that Heavenly Father smiled as I read that note, and that He did so through tears that were pretty similar to my own. And I bear you my direct, first-person witness that our Father is a man who loves love notes from a child, and the enthusiasm of teenage boys for hot rods, and giving generous gifts, and whispering to tired fathers in the quiet of the night. He longs to hold us in His arms again, as He has done so many times in the past, and have us hug Him back and claim Him as our own. Let us give that Father's Day gift to Him.</p>
