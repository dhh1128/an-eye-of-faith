<div>I want to comment on a feeling that one of my loved ones recently expressed--the idea that the church over-emphasizes ordinances.</div><div> </div><div>I am assuming that this particular doctrine feels unfair (why do some people get easy access to ordinances, and others not?), maybe a bit judgmental (how can we say whether someone is "right before the Lord" because they have or haven't received required ordinances?), maybe legalistic like the scribes and the pharisees.</div><div> </div><div>I can see some reasons for such feelings. Jesus rebuked the legalistic jews for straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel, and he said that the greatest commandments were to love God and love our neighbor. Those aren't ordinances.</div><div> </div><div>However, Jesus also told Nicodemus that except we are born of water and the spirit, we cannot be saved. His cousin, John the <span class="il">Baptist</span>, apparently thought ordinances mattered. And Jesus sent out his apostles with instructions to <span class="il">baptize</span>, on multiple occasions.</div><div><figure><img class="" src="http://media.ldscdn.org/images/media-library/gospel-art/gospel-in-action/baptism-boy-asians-37810-gallery.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="447" /><figcaption>Image credit: LDS Media Library</figcaption></figure></div><div>So what gives?</div><p><!--more--></p><div>A few months back, I was at the temple, doing <span class="il">baptisms</span> with Lauren and Maia. You've had that experience, I suppose: a person stands in the font, nose half-plugged, with water streaming off their face, going down and coming up, while they hear names of people they've never known.</div><div> </div><div>As I did the <span class="il">baptisms</span> with my daughters, the thought that was running through my mind was: "I hope these girls have a good experience. I hope they don't think this is boring and pointless."</div><div> </div><div>That got me thinking: why, exactly, is it so important that we do this stuff? Couldn't the Lord have just made it so people who died and wanted to accept the gospel could just... accept it, without so much fuss? Or couldn't he have just made it so that we could do one <span class="il">baptism</span> for a thousand or a million or a billion names at a time?</div><div> </div><div>After I thought this, I had an idea come to my mind that changed my perspective a lot. It was this: God is a personal, individual god, not an aggregate god, and His plan is a personal one. He doesn't see His children as a crowd; he sees each of us, one at a time. Moses got a glimpse of God's perspective; he beheld the inhabitants of the earth, and "there was not a soul which he beheld not." Notice the individuality of it. But when Moses got fixated on the vastness of creation, God emphasized something different: "innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">I know them</span>." </div><div> </div><div>In other words, God isn't interested in saving *all* of us, so much as He longs to save every last *one* of us, personally. The Savior who stood for hours while the Nephites came to feel his wounds, one by one, could never exemplify a Father's love that was just general, cosmic benevolence. Waving his hands with a broad pronouncement to save us all doesn't cut it, because that's not the kind of Father we have. It would be like a dad throwing one birthday party for all his children, and not letting each kid have their own special day. We have the kind of Heavenly Father who wants each of us to spend some personal, 1:1 time with him every day in prayer, and who makes Himself available for that without restriction. He has plenty of other stuff to do, but *that* is his priority. Heavenly Father's plan was one where every last one of His children gets their own, individual experience with salvation. Each one of us gets to go into the water, on our own. We are in the habit of saying that there is one baptismal prayer, as recorded in the Doctrine & Covenants--but in fact, that is wrong. There is a unique baptismal prayer for every single, last child of Heavenly Father. We each get our own, with our own unique name in it.</div><div> </div><div>This is why Heavenly Father's first word to Joseph Smith was "Joseph," not "This is my Beloved Son." This is why Jesus' first word at the garden tomb was "Mary," not "I have risen." Our names are, each, sacred to Him, because we are, each, sacred to Him.</div><div> </div><div>This is why we do <span class="il">baptisms</span> for the dead--because nothing else is good enough for God's children. Every child gets their own spiritual birthday party. One at a time. As long as it takes. That God would allocate a thousand years of earth's history to make sure it happens, and that He would rather have us get waterlogged and tired than speed up the process or skip somebody, tells us something. God's offer of an individual encounter with each of His children is totally non-negotiable.</div><div> </div><div>Now, back to the general question of "saving ordinances". What are they, really? They are not arbitrary requirements to be checked off, imposed by a demanding and impersonal deity. They are offers to have a personal encounter with God, where God doesn't just leave us with a warm feeling about what happened. Instead, God wants to go on record, with witnesses, that He loves this child whose name is part of the ordinance. God wants His promise to be written down, so that His child knows He means it. God wants to celebrate it. God wants it to be special. And He wants us to make it special, too.</div><div> </div><div>You don't have to be famous to have a saving ordinance. You don't have to be educated, or beautiful, or talented. You don't have to grow up in a first-world country. You don't have to be perfect.</div><div> </div><div>You just have to show up for your birthday party, of your own volition.</div><div> </div><div>Some of God's most wonderful children haven't had any or all of their saving ordinances, because they don't understand them. Does this mean they are bad people? No. Does it mean they are going to hell? No. Does it mean that the story isn't over? Yes.</div><div> </div><div>When all is said and done, each of God's children will understand that their Father is inviting them in to the feast, offering to covenant with them. When they understand that, then--and only then--will a rejection of the ordinances be a true failure or rejection of Him.</div><div> </div><div>Some of God's children want to flip this on its head. "How dare you ask us to show up for a birthday party!" they say. "Don't you love us regardless of whether we feel like attending?"</div><div> </div><div>Of course He loves his children who don't show up. If it's a matter of time, or expense, or inconvenience, He will spare no effort to make things work. He sends valiant sons and daughters to every corner of the world--to the Atacama desert, to Tokyo, to Siberia, to Nairobi and Mumbai and Hyden, Kentucky--to deliver invitations to the birthday party; and when one servant has to leave, he sends another servant, and another, and another, and another. He will--he has--quite literally move[d] heaven and earth.</div><div> </div><div>In the end, some of his children may still choose not to come. God will still set the table. He will have a beautiful cake. He will have other guests ready on a moment's notice to greet the guest of honor. And in the center of the table, in an envelope, there will be His present to that child: "Here's everything I have to give--absolutely everything your heart could possibly desire--a whole universe of it. All for you."</div><div> </div><div>Someone might say, "But what if I'm not the sort of person who likes birthday parties? I'd rather love God in a different way. Don't make me be something I'm not."</div><div> </div><div>That is each child's right; God will not force anyone to come. But I think it's a bit unfair to paint God as the demanding party in this scenario. He gives us life, in all its wonder and variety. He gives us agency. He teaches us moral laws, and He offers to help us be totally happy, if we will just believe that He knows what He's doing and His commandments and plan will work. And then He makes the ultimate sacrifice to enable our unfettered choice. If we walk away in such circumstances, it is like an ungrateful child who complains instead of honoring the tender efforts and sacrifice of the parent who threw them a party at enormous expense.</div><div> </div><div>God lives at the palace, and that's where He's inviting us--begging us--to come; we can't head out into the wilderness and then complain that we we got lousy accommodations because He was inhospitable.</div><div> </div><div>In other words, saving ordinances aren't an unfair imposition. They're proof positive of God's love and inclusiveness.</div>
