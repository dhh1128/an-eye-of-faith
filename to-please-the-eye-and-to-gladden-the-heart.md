This morning I was reading <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.18-19?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">Doctrine & Covenants 59</a>, and I was struck by verses 18 and 19:
<blockquote>Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart. Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.</blockquote>
What I like about this is that God isn't utilitarian. He doesn't limit His concern to just those things that make life possible; instead, He cares about whether we have perfumed roses, or sunsets drenched in color, or cute puppies, or delicious peaches--just because they gladden the heart. Whether we have a glad heart is something He cares about very deeply.

This is the same idea that's conveyed by one of my favorite Primary songs, "<a href="https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/my-heavenly-father-loves-me?lang=eng" target="_blank">My Heavenly Father Loves Me</a>." The lyrics are beautiful. Here's an excerpt:
<div style="margin-left:2em;margin-bottom:2em;">He gave me my eyes, that I might see
the color of butterfly wings.
He gave me my ears that I might hear
the magical sounds of things.</div>
This resonates for me. I can believe in a God who delights to share beauty--for no other reason than because it's uplifting and soul-satisfying. I am also reminded of a wonderful poem that my mother first shared with me:
<div style="margin-left:2em;">"Pied Beauty", by Gerard Manley Hopkins</div>
<div> </div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">GLORY be to God for dappled things—</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">  For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">    For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches’ wings;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">  Landscape plotted and pieced—fold, fallow, and plough;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">    And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;"></div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">All things counter, original, spare, strange;</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">  Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">    With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:</div>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">        Praise him.</div>
