It is no accident that <em>The Book of Mormon</em> begins with a story about a family. And folks, this is not a Mormon fairytale family, with neatly groomed children raptly clustered around joyful parents leading a Family Home Evening in a spotless living room, while choirs of angels provide background music.

<figure><img class="" src="http://media.ldscdn.org/images/media-library/gospel-art/book-of-mormon/nephi-subdues-rebellious-brothers-39641-gallery.jpg" alt="" width="327" height="447" /><figcaption>Nephi Subdues His Rebellious Brothers, by Arnold Friberg; 1 Nephi 17:15–55.</figcaption></figure>

In the first few pages we read about pride and bitterness among siblings, a generation gap, broken-hearted parents, wayward and ungrateful children, a lonely single man, and a distant relative addicted to drink and consorting with evil friends in shadowy nightlife. Keep reading, and you’ll find verbal and physical abuse, arguments about money, sons in danger on deployment, depression, death of elderly parents, childbearing in near-starvation conditions, reluctant moves to unfamiliar places, lazy and dishonest husbands, several attempted murders, and a wild, immoral party. And we aren’t even out of 1st Nephi yet!

Now, that might seem like a sensationalized list, but I offer it to make a point: <em>The Book of Mormon</em> was written for our day. The Lord cares about our families. He cares that we feel desperate and overwhelmed, that we have private sorrows. Maybe your neighbor doesn’t know what it’s like to have a spouse who’s struggling with pornography, or to be childless, or to be lonely and single, or to agonize with same-sex attraction, or to ache over wayward children, or to fight mental or emotional illness every hour of every day, or to grind through unemployment and financial ruin with no obvious sunshine on the horizon, or to watch a loved one suffer with a terminal illness.

But <i>He</i> does.

And, incredible as it may sound, that book of books--the one that talks so much about tough family problems--is not a downer! Nephi reports that he lived “after the manner of happiness” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5.27?lang=eng#26" target="_blank">2 Ne 5:27</a>). Despite his troubles, he finds joy and comfort in an atoning, compassionate Savior that can heal his heart and his family in ways he does not understand. “Nevertheless,” he says, “I know in whom I have trusted” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.19?lang=eng#16" target="_blank">2 Ne 4:19</a>). <i>That</i> is the topic of every lesson in every Sunday School class, no matter who’s teaching and what the name of the class is.

Think of the other family stories that the Editor with a capital E inserted in <em>The Book of Mormon</em>. Enos repents because of the words of his father. Abish, lonely and surrounded by wordliness, clings to the faith and the testimony of her youth and emerges triumphant. Alma rebels, but is rescued by a God so loving and compassionate that even hearts as hard as stone are melted. Lamoni’s father stops attacking a missionary and accepts the gospel in his old age. Corianton forsakes a life of immorality and becomes a dedicated missionary. A Lamanite queen holds vigil by the bedside of a husband in a coma. Sons love and trust their mothers so much that they risk their lives with perfect faith in childhood teachings. Mormon worries about his son growing up in a world of encroaching darkness and evil...

I find it so very encouraging that when the Lord put together a book about families, He filled it with stories my own family can relate to...
