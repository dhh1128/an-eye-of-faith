During the 2012 presidential campaign, I ran across an online magazine article about LDS garments. The comment stream after the article was predictably busy. One thread raised the age-old question of whether the temple ceremony, garments, and related topics are “sacred” or “secret”. Latter-day saints prefer “sacred”; many outside the church consider this a disingenuous splitting-of-hairs. One commenter said something like, “Well, if you can’t talk about it, it’s by definition a secret.”

I think I understand why someone would feel the way this commenter did. Although the distinction is familiar in LDS culture<sup>[<a href="#1">1</a>]</sup>, and is more than mere wordplay, it is not something that we explain very well.

Perhaps the following will help.

The undiscussed details of temple matters bear a strong resemblance to another circumstance that people of all backgrounds readily understand: happily married couples are reluctant to discuss the details of their physical intimacy with others. What happens between them is not supposed to be a deep, dark secret &mdash; in fact, the set of people aware of what physical intimacy entails is unbounded, and as the set grows, it does not cheapen or threaten the couple. But out of respect for each other, and to preserve the integrity of the bond that unites them, that aspect of their lives is not shared &mdash; even with others who are similarly informed. It is sacred territory; casual travel cheapens it.

Similarly, members of the LDS church are taught that some aspects of the temple experience should not be shared. Those matters are intended to have sacred, personal meaning, explorable only between an individual and God, who works in our minds and hearts through His Spirit.

It is important to understand that this standard does not just preclude discussing temple matters with the uninitiated &mdash; it also precludes discussing them with one’s spouse, closest friends, or church leaders, even if such people are thoroughly aware of the details of temple ordinances themselves. The temple experience is between you and God; no other parties get a seat at the table. It is simply none of their business.

Describing temple matters as a “secret” conveys a certain amount of truth, but it fails to capture the essence. I think that’s why Mormons often fall back to the “sacred” versus “secret” distinction. There is no requirement to actively prevent others from learning information about the temple &mdash; only a commitment not to be personally responsible for cheapening it. LDS scholar Hugh Nibley put it this way:
<blockquote>… The important thing is that I do not reveal these things; they must remain sacred to me. I must preserve a zone of sanctity which cannot be violated. … For my covenants are all between me and my Heavenly Father.”<sup>[<a href="#2">2</a>]</sup></blockquote>
Consider the parallel with physical intimacy.

Some things can be said. In temple ordinances, we commit ourselves to obey God and to put Him first in our lives. We commit ourselves to absolute fidelity to our spouse. We commit ourselves to strive to do good, to be honest, to live by the scriptures, and to repent and rely on Jesus Christ to save us when our efforts are flawed (as they always are).

It is also possible to make some clear statements about what is not part of the temple experience. There is no unseemly, immoral, or immodest behavior; indeed, nothing could be further from reality. There are no conspiracies, no dark oaths, not subversive plots, no criticisms of people of other faiths.

I suppose a conspiracy theorist could construct an imaginary temple experience that consists of all sorts of vile stuff, and then explain my summary as outright deception required by that evil. To any that might be inclined to this perspective, I am not sure what else I could say. I guess my final suggestion would be that you examine the lives of ordinary LDS women and men that you know, who’ve been through the temple. I’m not talking about the political figures and prominent church leaders and disaffected ex-Mormons and other strident voices out there; I’m talking about the mom who sits next to you at PTA meetings, or the guy who works on your team at the office. Ordinary Mormons make peanut butter sandwiches for their kids, worry about their teenagers getting in car accidents, scrimp and save to pay college tuition, rush to the hospital when Grandma has a stroke, and make as many mistakes living life as anybody else. I’m sure you know that they’re not ideal people, but I hope you also see that many of them are trying to live honorably. Are they secretive and sinister? Do they seem like radical subversives? These are relevant questions, because ordinary LDS people go to the temple and make the commitments entailed by that experience, all the time. Don’t you think their lives would suggest what those commitments are?

Finally, it is worth noting that it is not offensive to Mormons to ask sincere questions. If you want to know something about the temple experience, do not assume that you’ll be stonewalled at every turn if you broach the subject. Just ask. Many temple-related topics have straightforward answers that have been published for general audiences. If the question is not something we feel comfortable answering, we’ll tell you.
