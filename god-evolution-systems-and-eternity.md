<span style="font-weight:400;">In my discipline of software architecture, one buzzword that invites occasional discussion is </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">system thinking</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. This is the notion that certain things can only be understood as a whole or gestalt, not as independent pieces. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</span>

[caption id="attachment_115" align="alignnone" width="2412"]<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115" src="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/system.jpg" alt="system" width="2412" height="1300" /> <span style="color:#808080;"><em>(partial map of the internet, from The Opte Project, Wikimedia Commons; http://bit.ly/2PrfOte)</em></span>[/caption]

<span style="font-weight:400;">I see this constantly in software. Building something complex like the Facebook ecosystem is more than just building the pieces. It involves the mustering of technical, legal, business, and cultural forces in multiple dimensions, across large spans of time. There's incredible interplay and feedback loops. I've </span><a href="smart-geeks-think-like-cheerleaders"><span style="font-weight:400;">blogged about this</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, </span><a href="on-seps-squirrels-and-meta-questions"><span style="font-weight:400;">more than once</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">But of course this is not just a computer thing. Analysis (breaking things down) and synthesis (understanding things together) is a civilization-wide dialectic between western and eastern paradigms. And system thinking--or the lack thereof--is relevant everywhere. In politics, granular decisions about X and Y get debated on their individual merits, but the cumulative cultural momentum of hundreds of political choices and thousands of situations are rarely understood or discussed to my satisfaction, because we want sound bites. The unit of decision-making is an individual law or executive order or press conference or treaty. In arguments between teenagers and spouses, I see one side focusing like a laser on a small injustice, but not wanting to acknowledge the tapestry of interactions in which they were a full participant and against which the particular offense stands out. In health care, we diagnose discrete problems and prescribe discrete solutions with limited success. What if the real solution to a diabetes epidemic involves variables like diet and exercise, or (moving to progressively higher-order systems) screen time as a hobby in America, or patterns of work/life balance in Western culture, or correcting flaws in the economic model of capitalism, or all of the above, all at once?</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Several years ago, I was listening to a performance of a hymn ("Amazing Grace", IIRC). The words felt poignant, and I had a revelatory moment where I understood how their message applied directly and personally to me. I felt a burst of gratitude, and I said a spontaneous, silent prayer of thanks that I'd been placed in a situation where I would hear that performance.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">In response to that prayer of thanks, a thought came into my mind then that has altered my perspective ever since. I heard unspoken words more or less like these: "You're welcome. I have been working on this moment for you for a long time. I gave talents to people who were born 200 years ago. I inspired the musician who selected the chords. I helped Western culture invent the diatonic scale upon which this music is based. I inspired the woman who put it in a hymnbook and the mother who convinced this pianist to practice as a child. I helped the vocalist fall in love with this hymn and want to perform it. I helped the lyricist on his personal journey from oppressor to penitent, and then nudged him to put pen to paper. I am happy that you can see the fruition of my love for you."</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">In other words, blessing me through the music was not best understood as the result of a single discrete action taken by God on that particular day. It was just one manifestation of an entire system of behavior that stretched back through eternity. My awareness and imagination of it barely scratched the surface. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">There was an unspoken corollary: although I was seeing the musical performance through the lens of how it affected me, all of these blessing actions were part of a multidimensional system that also aimed to bless an infinite number of others. And my joy and my learning moment that day were themselves part of the same system of goodness. They would ripple outward for divine ends I couldn't know.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Remember Elder Bednar's talk about brush strokes on a canvas producing a glorious painting--but only when viewed as a totality instead of as discrete items?</span>

<a href="https://youtu.be/VZljNTyemcU?t=651"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118" src="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/screen-shot-2018-12-07-at-4-02-11-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-12-07 at 4.02.11 PM.png" width="2344" height="1228" /></a>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Scriptural descriptions of God include "the same from all eternity to all eternity", "eternal and unchanging", "the beginning and the end", and "the great I AM." He says "all things are present before me." I believe one meaning of such statements is that God relates to The System differently than we do. It is all comprehended as one great and beautiful whole for Him, and He is in and through all of it.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">We are such limited creatures. We experience time sequentially, and the people we are tomorrow are different from the people we were yesterday. Even if our </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">natures</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> didn't change at all from day to day, the thoughts we could think in relation to unfolding events would differ from one moment to the next. But if God is truly the same at all points in time, I imagine it might mean that he is thinking and experiencing all of His thoughts with respect to all events--the whole System--simultaneously and forever. This morning when He listened to my prayers, he was also talking to Moses on Mt. Sinai, and weeping with Enoch, and inspiring Mother Teresa to found a hospital in Calcutta, and chastening me for the selfish choices I made as a teenager. All of it is there together, all at once--just as all of the events leading up to my moment of joy with a hymn, and everything connected to it up and down, forward and backward, left and right, are all there, too.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">A Jewish teen needs comfort and instruction in 600 BC in Jerusalem. A 14-year-old boy seeks help in 1820. A modern missionary needs to learn to compliment her companion more. An Iranian mother in the 1960s needs to teach her daughter Isabel a principle about loving truth. And Isabel, today, needs to remember that principle so she'll be receptive to the door approach of the missionary companion who needs a confidence boost. If all this potential comes together right, three years from now Isabel can take her deceased mother's name to the temple and unlock experiences for her on the other side of the veil.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">Seeing this, God (the ultimate "thing to act rather than be acted upon") breathes gently into The System at all of these points, all at once. It is not so much discrete actions, as it is a sunshine of goodness that lights up everything it touches. Nephi's experience and the restoration of the gospel and the temple work for the Iranian mother are one and the same divine orchestration, and time/sequencing is a limited, human artificiality that doesn't constrain God at all.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">So, finally, let me bend back to the topic of evolution. I believe in intelligent design--but not the sort that's usually imagined. I don't think God just showed up a few times along the way to steer life, or that he set clockworks in motion and sat back to watch it all unfold. Both of those formulations feel like silly trivializations to me. Rather, I think God's nature as a loving, intelligent, and powerful being pulls Him irresistibly into participation with the System. How could He stand to withhold His sunshine from even one corner of the universe, for even a moment?</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">I don't know if modern science has all the particulars of evolution right. Most parts of it feel pretty correct to me, and a few parts are still under </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleonomy"><span style="font-weight:400;">intense debate in academic circles</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. But I would be astonished if the economy of heaven ordained a physical world that operated according to beautiful and profound laws, and then took arbitrary shortcuts through the System. It would be like Rembrandt pulling out a canvas and getting his paints set up, and then slapping a newsprint photo of his subject on the canvas so he didn't have to waste so much time painting the face.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114" src="https://aneyeoffaith.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/rembrandt.jpg" alt="rembrandt" width="2114" height="1168" />

<span style="font-weight:400;">God is more patient, more loving, more involved, and more of a Craftsman than that. We might be tempted to wave a magic wand to create a fish; we think of time as a finite resource and genetic engineering as something done in weeks with million-dollar lab equipment. But God can build a fish the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">right</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> way. And so He does. The recipe says it takes several billion years of cook time? No problem. After all, the Master is not in a hurry, and fishes are vital. They are how he is going to feed 5000, and thence redeem a penitent slave trader, and bless Isabel and her mother. And they are going to feed a little girl in Bangladesh tomorrow. Are not the cell membrane in a tide pool a billion years ago, and the prompting to a missionary companion today, and a trillion trillion other details like unto them, really one continuous, ineffable, incomprehensible act of unutterable love and atonement?</span>

<i><span style="font-weight:400;">Of course</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> we can't point to a smoking gun that proves an Intelligent Designer intervened. That's because He's not a limited interventionist. He's a </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">participant</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, and His touch is so pervasive that it's woven into all of reality. We're like fish who can't see the water. But it is there. The Living Water is there.</span>

Very well said, my friend! I have never considered God’s involvement quite that way before.
